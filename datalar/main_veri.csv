Zoe Luce,9/28/2023,this is a really fun game with lots of potential.. but like.. you get one map and if you want other maps they're $5 a piece after already paying $3.99 for the game.. so as soon as you unlock your collectables on your one and only map it gets boring and you don't want to play anymore. Maps should be unlockable.. imo was super fun to play though reminds me of the old PlayStation game of life back in the day. Use to be my favorite.,Value for Money,0.4324399530887604
Ashley M,4/29/2021,"I've been looking for a game that I can play that doesn't require coins or dumping money into it to keep going. This is the one. Really fun with length gameplay. Some people don't like the lack of character customization. I don't mind it too much, but that is one area of improvement I see. Can't complain much though - the lack of being bombarded with ads, no coins or timed rewards to play, id gladly pay .99 for a cute character outfit. Awesome job with this one!",Content and Length,0.35913780331611633
Adam Taylor,6/20/2021,"You get 1 map, then have to pay for each map after. Spinner is not actually random. I've tested this, and the spinner will only give you certain numbers, based on your choice at the stops. The computer characters make terrible choices, yet are very ""lucky"" when it comes to landing on the spot they need. You usually win the game, but this game is full of errors. You also spend more time waiting for the other characters to finish, than anything else. This could be a great game,",Gameplay and Controls,0.49856752157211304

DRG BS,7/17/2020,"It is ok, but here is an issue that I'd like to address for improvement. Online play is a disparaging experience. People tend to quit with no repercussions for it. The game is slow but with details, it is fine if people don't bail. You can tell a player quits when it takes 4 minutes for it to ""auto"" spin. Also, when a player has quit and lands on an action/event tile, the game stops progressing! Stuck until the ""player"" clicks an option.

I pretty much got most of the achievements filled for the free/first/only board you can play. I found myself bored of the same board. I think each board to unlock costs 3.99 or 4.99 (US).

Kinda regretting spending $4 on this game I hope they do some improvements. It says it has more choices than the 1st an it really doesn't I mean family wise the 1st one has children scattered around the board.

My suggestions to you is this, in the original game we had twins, children gave retirement money. Each player gave a gift for one child. In the app game we had the option to have triplets/quads, please bring this back.

Melissa Torres,8/9/2020,"My 7-year old and I love playing the game! The graphics are great and she loves seeing what happens when she makes different life choices. With that said: 1. We would like to see at least 4 different player tokens so there are not 4 wheels, skateboards or birds when looking at the aerial view of the game board. Once a token is selected, it can't be used by another player. 2. Is there a way to personalize the name for Player 2, 3 and 4 when there are 4 humans playing? We tried everything in the edit mode including tapping the name plate and nothing works to change the name. The names do change when they are computer players. If there is a way to change to names when in ""human"" mode, it is not intuitive. 3. As other players mentioned we do wish there was an option for a longer board. I like the short version that exists right now but when we have time for a longer game, another few routes would be great, with more house spaces, salary spaces and other perks. Does not seem to be very many house spaces, we've played many games when neither of us had more than one degree and both had zero houses. We do love the 2nd chance spots!! 4. The ""risk"" road seems boring since it's all Wheels of Fate with a few Taxes spots sandwiched in. We hate landing on a Wheel of Fate because we ALWAYS get Taxes. Also where is the reward for taking the risk? Would be nice to have a couple of very large financial gains on that street, like a $500k spot and a House Inheritance or something. How about a free scholarship for another degree? 5. Does it matter which spouse you choose if you go down the Marriage road? Are there advantages over one or the other? This isn't explained, unless there are no special advantages of one over another (there should be if there are not). I guess same thought on kids, are there advantages to having kids? If yes, what are they? 6. I would like to be able to pay back debt when I get paid my salary, that would be a nice ""pause"" option when cruising over a paycheck collection space. 7. It's nice having two career choices after completing an education purchase but we always take the higher paying job, why would we choose the other one? THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME GAME!!!
