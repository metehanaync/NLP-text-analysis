K S,9/5/2020,"Meh...I like some of the options they've added like adopting pets and the gender neutral character, the option not to get married, but there just doesn't seem to be as much variety or as many options as the first one. It just kind of feels extended and dragged out. The only thing you really work at is getting the achievements. Graphics are better of course but not really enough to grab me. Played it a couple of time to see if it got more interesting. Nope. Get #1 if you want to play.",negative,0.6153126358985901
Julianne,8/7/2020,"The game is fun but short. Especially since the spin function doesn't work well. The amount of times I spin and get a 7, 8, 9, or 10 doesn't seem statistically fair. I feel like I am always going to spin high, thus landing on barely anything good or bad. I wish there was an option for a longer board. At very least, an improvement to randomozation of the spin or use dice instead.",negative,0.8019011616706848
Mischa Bodenschatz,5/28/2022,"I really enjoy the game. The only problems I have is that I can no longer play on my switch, and on my phone the maps cost money. When I try to play on the switch the map turns purple, and all I can see is the cards. Please fix this glitch. And if it is not to much make a 4 dollar expansion pack of all the maps. Make the separately maps 1 dollar each. That will get you a lot more buys. Other than these two things the game is amazing.",negative,0.6806155443191528
LG Hakubi,7/18/2021,"It's okay. I like the updates but the old board game feels more full and dynamic. The spinner needs adjustments because it's way too easy to blast to the end of the game without getting any options. Like I always blow by the family and investment tiles when going down those routes yet somehow I always land on taxes. The game only runs long because you have to wait for everyone, the board isn't large at all. Fast forward should just stay on. DLC costs are incredibly high and not worth it.",neutral,0.4402449131011963

Kinda regretting spending $4 on this game I hope they do some improvements. It says it has more choices than the 1st an it really doesn't I mean family wise the 1st one has children scattered around the board.

But sadly the way you receive attributes is just by random chance, especially after you retire. You also have to hope you land on an orange spot to buy a home, and the lucky numbers add nothing to the game. Same experience every time...

I love the new options like having a pet rather than a child but the changes in gameplay are disappointing. I played 3 games and never once got a house, that's disappointing. The life tiles are really low stakes now. Everyone is having guitar lessons or upgrading their computers rather than vacations or sending kids to summer camp.

Cost of things in the game like surfing lessons are ridiculous, not to mention the cost of the game itself. Paid $6 for it and its only the basic version.

Hillary D.,1/2/2021,Wonderful game and beautifully illustrated. Highly recommend if you like the classic board game. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it won't let me use the 'online multi-player' because it says I don't have an internet connection when I do (wifi).

Melissa Torres,8/9/2020,"My 7-year old and I love playing the game! The graphics are great and she loves seeing what happens when she makes different life choices. With that said: 1. We would like to see at least 4 different player tokens so there are not 4 wheels, skateboards or birds when looking at the aerial view of the game board. Once a token is selected, it can't be used by another player. 2. Is there a way to personalize the name for Player 2, 3 and 4 when there are 4 humans playing? We tried everything in the edit mode including tapping the name plate and nothing works to change the name. The names do change when they are computer players. If there is a way to change to names when in ""human"" mode, it is not intuitive. 3. As other players mentioned we do wish there was an option for a longer board. I like the short version that exists right now but when we have time for a longer game, another few routes would be great, with more house spaces, salary spaces and other perks. Does not seem to be very many house spaces, we've played many games when neither of us had more than one degree and both had zero houses. We do love the 2nd chance spots!! 4. The ""risk"" road seems boring since it's all Wheels of Fate with a few Taxes spots sandwiched in. We hate landing on a Wheel of Fate because we ALWAYS get Taxes. Also where is the reward for taking the risk? Would be nice to have a couple of very large financial gains on that street, like a $500k spot and a House Inheritance or something. How about a free scholarship for another degree? 5. Does it matter which spouse you choose if you go down the Marriage road? Are there advantages over one or the other? This isn't explained, unless there are no special advantages of one over another (there should be if there are not). I guess same thought on kids, are there advantages to having kids? If yes, what are they? 6. I would like to be able to pay back debt when I get paid my salary, that would be a nice ""pause"" option when cruising over a paycheck collection space. 7. It's nice having two career choices after completing an education purchase but we always take the higher paying job, why would we choose the other one? THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME GAME!!!
