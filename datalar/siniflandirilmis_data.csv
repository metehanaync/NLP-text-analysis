Zoe Luce,9/28/2023,this is a really fun game with lots of potential.. but like.. you get one map and if you want other maps they're $5 a piece after already paying $3.99 for the game.. so as soon as you unlock your collectables on your one and only map it gets boring and you don't want to play anymore. Maps should be unlockable.. imo was super fun to play though reminds me of the old PlayStation game of life back in the day. Use to be my favorite.,positive,0.6803325414657593
Ashley M,4/29/2021,"I've been looking for a game that I can play that doesn't require coins or dumping money into it to keep going. This is the one. Really fun with length gameplay. Some people don't like the lack of character customization. I don't mind it too much, but that is one area of improvement I see. Can't complain much though - the lack of being bombarded with ads, no coins or timed rewards to play, id gladly pay .99 for a cute character outfit. Awesome job with this one!",positive,0.8710657358169556
Adam Taylor,6/20/2021,"You get 1 map, then have to pay for each map after. Spinner is not actually random. I've tested this, and the spinner will only give you certain numbers, based on your choice at the stops. The computer characters make terrible choices, yet are very ""lucky"" when it comes to landing on the spot they need. You usually win the game, but this game is full of errors. You also spend more time waiting for the other characters to finish, than anything else. This could be a great game,",negative,0.4618437886238098
K S,9/5/2020,"Meh...I like some of the options they've added like adopting pets and the gender neutral character, the option not to get married, but there just doesn't seem to be as much variety or as many options as the first one. It just kind of feels extended and dragged out. The only thing you really work at is getting the achievements. Graphics are better of course but not really enough to grab me. Played it a couple of time to see if it got more interesting. Nope. Get #1 if you want to play.",negative,0.6153126358985901
DRG BS,7/17/2020,"It is ok, but here is an issue that I'd like to address for improvement. Online play is a disparaging experience. People tend to quit with no repercussions for it. The game is slow but with details, it is fine if people don't bail. You can tell a player quits when it takes 4 minutes for it to ""auto"" spin. Also, when a player has quit and lands on an action/event tile, the game stops progressing! Stuck until the ""player"" clicks an option. I waited for 20+ min. and the 2 choices were still there!",negative,0.8064666390419006
Julianne,8/7/2020,"The game is fun but short. Especially since the spin function doesn't work well. The amount of times I spin and get a 7, 8, 9, or 10 doesn't seem statistically fair. I feel like I am always going to spin high, thus landing on barely anything good or bad. I wish there was an option for a longer board. At very least, an improvement to randomozation of the spin or use dice instead.",negative,0.8019011616706848
Miranda Danforth,1/30/2021,"I wish there were more board options without having to buy an add-on, it's gets a little repetitive. That being said I really enjoy the game, no issues with connecting to other players online. My daughter and I love to play the pass it mode a lot too. I love the new outfits and such that you can earn like little achievements. It's basically a faster version of the old school board game.",positive,0.7763086557388306
Saigey Marie,5/31/2021,"The maps could be longer or have an option to switch to 1-5 instead of 1-10 to make it longer and be able to land on more spaces in the game. Could have added power ups or minigames to make it more interesting. The layout is the same in all of them, only the theme is different. I do like the ability to unlock more vehicles, outfits and portraits and the fact there is a nonbinary character. Overall the game is fun but it could be enhanced for better gameplay.",positive,0.6566812992095947
April Sherman,6/9/2021,"Awesome graphics. However I just downloaded the game today and it's already buggy. It started freezing up repeatedly in a game to the point where I had to exit least twice to get the game going, and then finally I wasn't even giving the option to exit anymore and I had to shut the app down and reopen. That caused me to lose the remainder of the game.",negative,0.9253332614898682
Bethany Ng Tang,8/25/2021,"Was really excited to download this game. What you get for $4 is 1 board, the standard outfits and cars, and if you complete 6 ""missions"" you can unlock some really disappointing outfits and 2 cars that look alike. If you want the FULL game, it's $34.99+tax. Outfits start at $.99 and can go up to $3.99, with new boards for $5 a piece. Extremely let down for a game I paid for.",positive,0.5890041589736938
Nicholas R,9/1/2021,"It's a pretty decent mobile game to pass the time. No advertisements which is good since you have to pay money for it. It's a little small in content however. And pretty heavily focused on RNG. But it is modeled after The Game of Life board game which is entirely luck based. This, however, makes it annoying when trying to complete a specific challenge. You can go 4 games in a row and never have a baby just because of unlucky spins. Overall it's pretty good, but could definitely be improved upon",positive,0.6675873398780823
Mischa Bodenschatz,5/28/2022,"I really enjoy the game. The only problems I have is that I can no longer play on my switch, and on my phone the maps cost money. When I try to play on the switch the map turns purple, and all I can see is the cards. Please fix this glitch. And if it is not to much make a 4 dollar expansion pack of all the maps. Make the separately maps 1 dollar each. That will get you a lot more buys. Other than these two things the game is amazing.",negative,0.6806155443191528
Kate Hoyt,8/4/2020,"The map is too short. In most of my playthroughs none of the players get a house, let alone buy and sell more than one. Seems like a waste of an idea since it's so rare to land on a house space. There are also many playthroughs without any pets or kids. The map is just too short to experience the content. Also each game has 4 players but there are only 3 different icons to choose. Other than that, it is fun!",negative,0.7936925292015076
LG Hakubi,7/18/2021,"It's okay. I like the updates but the old board game feels more full and dynamic. The spinner needs adjustments because it's way too easy to blast to the end of the game without getting any options. Like I always blow by the family and investment tiles when going down those routes yet somehow I always land on taxes. The game only runs long because you have to wait for everyone, the board isn't large at all. Fast forward should just stay on. DLC costs are incredibly high and not worth it.",neutral,0.4402449131011963
Reiko Aburame\Breezy Bree,1/31/2021,"The game is excellent, the graphics are great, everything pretty much is good except for multiplayer when someone is taking too long.

Laura Herman,2/18/2022,"I love it! It's much more fun and enjoyable than the board game, plus there's online multiplayer too, which makes it that much better. However, there is a bug I noticed... Often, in online multiplayer, when someone chooses a job, the game shows the one they didn't pick when it decides their number, it can get confusing. Other than that, it's an amazing game! I purchased the season pass and I don't regret it!",positive,0.9654927849769592
B. P.,1/28/2021,"It's a decent game, but the turns can take too long for online play. Also, there are definitely glitches and bugs that need to be addressed.

I have a Note20 Ultra, and this game constantly freezes..",negative,0.8826546669006348
Constance Fontenot,6/21/2021,I love everything about the game but I have a few problems. When playing by myself I literally just now have lost 10 times in a row from the bottom. Please fix. And I keep trying to land on family to complete one of the collections and with 10 games I haven't landed on family once even with risky route and everything. Please pay attention and try to fix. I will give it 5 stars cause other than that it's perfect!,negative,0.7675856351852417
Cierra Berrie,9/2/2020,I really enjoy this game! But with the update I lost all of my collectibles... Also seeing a longer game option would be wonderful! I enjoy the shorter board too but having that variety would be a lot of fun. More house spots and more job spots. Even so more risk. Maybe adding in a lose your job space(s) just to make things a little more interesting.,positive,0.9448887705802917
J Barefoot,2/12/2021,It's ok. I didn't mind paying to download. I just hate that you have to pay more to unlock new boards. I pretty much got most of the achievements filled for the free/first/only board you can play. I found myself bored of the same board. I think each board to unlock costs 3.99 or 4.99 (US). Then if you want to unlock other vehicles or outfits etc it too cost 99-3.99. It's ok overall. Going to uninstall though since I got bored of it.,negative,0.6469863653182983
Holly Hedges,3/16/2021,"Not worth it. You pay to download and if you want to open any more boards you have to pay for them. They should have made it so you unlock new boards as you accomplish tasks. I could understand paying for extras like avatars, outfits, and vehicles, but the boards shouldn't be a paid item. It was fun for the first couple of times, but it got boring really quickly. Unless you buy the new boards the game quickly loses its luster.",negative,0.7731763124465942
Chyanne DeLong,12/14/2020,Pay to play game 💰💰💰 If you have alot of money then you can really enjoy the app. Cause when I bought it I thought I would have gotten all of it but I was wrong. It includes season passes you can choose to pay. But the game gets boring once you finish the original one. Honestly it feels like the computer is not going getting to pay taxes or and is always getting high numbers and is always going first. It also seems that the computer ends up but gets money 💰 from me but not the taxes.,positive,0.8138478398323059
Rosemary Hernandez,10/24/2020,"If I would have known we only get to play 1 map and have to pay for the others, I would have never purchased this.

I don't recommend if you only want to play 1 map or don't mind paying more for each map.",negative,0.6806058287620544
Wesley Coon,7/16/2020,I love this game so far! Couple of things though! 1) there needs to be a timer for when an online opponent takes too much time just to speed up the game. 2) I feel like different game modes would be an awesome way to kill time and earn prizes. If that's not possible I understand! Overall love the game and I hope to see some great improvements!!!,positive,0.9573578834533691
Ronnie Hulen,4/1/2023,"Really fun, idle type game. The transactions and bundles are set up beautifully! I didn't want the Frozen Lands bundle, but I really wanted the bear avatar; boom, 99¢ and I got the only thing I wanted, rather than having to fork over $4 for a bunch of things I don't.

Fatima Gaskins,7/30/2021,"It's the game of life, but better. The reason for a low rating is that I paid $3.99 for it. Doesn't that mean I should be able to unlock new aspects of the game for free? Why is it $34.99 for all locked content at a ""steal"" of 73% off or $4.99 each? I have no problem paying for a great game, but that should come with a way to unlock all game content for free.

In single player mode, you can raise the speed of the bots to 5X. Shortcomings are that even though I paid for the game, I still have to pay more money for any bells & whistles.

I got my refund and I will not be putting it on my device again. I wish the first game was still being worked on, this is a huge letdown when I was expecting to be blown away.

Misty Roop,5/1/2022,"The only way to win the game is to choose to stay single and take the investment route. If you get married and go the family route, you lose every time. I also felt that it could last longer. The board seems much shorter, and there is not very much variety between the life cards or job cards. They are very repetitive. Too many things have been changed in not so good ways in my opinion. It's a poor sequel to a great classic game.",negative,0.6742482781410217

I really enjoy the van mini-game and the 10 meter run one from the first one and think they would fit here too over just doing spins for the highest number.

Vanessa Fundora,7/26/2020,In the Game of Life the first one the game play has many more options more styles and mini games this just isn't hitting the spot for me like the 1st one. Kinda regretting spending $4 on this game I hope they do some improvements. It says it has more choices than the 1st an it really doesn't I mean family wise the 1st one has children scattered around the board. I feel like the Board is shorter than the original one as well...I would like to know when I will get my refund back. Thank you,negative,0.8265432119369507
Sarah Holt,9/16/2020,"If you like playing the board game, then you will like this version. You have multiple options to play, individual, pass to a friend, even online against other players. You can collect puzzle pieces by accomplishing different tasks as you play and unveil new vehicles, outfits and avatars. I love the online feature and different world. Look forward to more in future.",positive,0.9663401246070862
Caleb Whiting,1/20/2021,"Great game with solid replayability, but caught me off guard with misleading in app purchases. I bought one of the ""new worlds"" to play with my girlfriend only to discover that it only changes the cosmetic appearance without altering the original board in any way. Advertised as ""new worlds, visuals and cosmetics"", you would expect an entire new board rather than a skin. I would typically request a refund, however, the game is still enjoyable and I wish the developers all the best.",negative,0.59113609790802
Leah Gibbons,5/17/2023,"This game is very fun. I wish we could change the names of the players in Pass and Play, that we could oust players who are taking a really long time to make moves in Online Multiplayer, and that we could view the different houses/jobs, etc. that we've gotten throughout the game. Also, the family choices are glitchy; I've chosen dog and gotten a cat, I've chosen a girl baby and gotten a boy. It's not cool that you have to pay $4.99 each to unlock other boards when the game already costs $.",positive,0.6793302893638611
Kaylin F,1/10/2021,Game is okay but for the price I wouldn't really say worth it. Its very short and I have had it freeze on me 3 or 4 times. When it freezes you miss out on some in game stuff and it just jumps to your turn so you don't really know what happened. It has a bunch of potential but I wouldn't say its worth the money at this point. Make the board longer or at least give the option for a longer board and work out the little kinks and it would definitely be a great game,negative,0.7220203876495361

Masquerade PW,7/29/2021,"Fun but flawed. While the game is fun, it's hard to tell whether you're playing against AI or players. Frequently, you'll end up facing opponents who only get perfect rolls. This makes it frustrating to play because the RNG begins feeling incredibly lopsided. It's also tough to play with friends because you can't invite friends to matchmade sessions - if you want to play with your friends, you'll have to accept that your only other opponents will be the AI. Ultimately, I recommend the game",negative,0.8234171271324158
Elizabeth Pringle,8/18/2020,"This version is so much better than the original! Theres much more freedom in how you play, so you're not really 'required' to get married and have children to win. It's more about the experiences you gather, so I won by staying single, buying my own apartment and adopting a cat and dog while studying for a masters degree!

Mr. Cooper,2/9/2022,Problems: 1. 5x game speed resets every time a human player has a turn. 1x speed is far too slow even for a human player. 2. 5x game mode causes the game to regularly freeze. 3. There is no variation between maps other than the art. 4. 30 children requires too many replays of map to secure the collectible. The number required should be akin to the house requirement. 5. The intro should be skipable. 6. The computer AI too frequently makes poor decisions. 7. The spinner is RNG controlled.,negative,0.7791311144828796
Bekka Babcock,7/20/2020,Price was decent.

This game is just so easy I can say even a 5 yr old child can win every single time if he knows what to do. There are just too less variables in this game, it makes winning too easy.

I'm fine with having some microtransactions to get customizations and what not (like you have) but not with having to pay for 10 out of 11 maps (that will be released in the future).

John Dean,8/13/2020,"I would give this game 5 stars for playability but for a 4 dollar game, the amount of paid add-ons is insane. $30 for a season pass?!? Apex Legends and games alike don't charge nearly that much and add incentives to the pass. Player skins should be unlockable by player currency that could be implemented in the game but they want to charge $1 for a peg with clothes on it. I much prefer the original game of life.

If you're facing a crash issue, go the app setting (Android App Setting) and give it mic permission, if you are okay being recorded by a game app. Personally, I'm uninstalling and getting refund.

Chris Faulk,3/23/2023,I will agree with other reviews that the game mechanics are not at all random or fair. CPU very often gets high number spin or lands on the perfect spot or gets max value for house sale OR high salary OR lands on their own lucky number multiple times in a row. I just played and spun 3 or under 7 times in a row. I actually used to win games but have been 4th place (I do know how to place this game) the last several times I've played.

Melissa Torres,8/9/2020,"My 7-year old and I love playing the game! The graphics are great and she loves seeing what happens when she makes different life choices. With that said: 1. We would like to see at least 4 different player tokens so there are not 4 wheels, skateboards or birds when looking at the aerial view of the game board. Once a token is selected, it can't be used by another player. 2. Is there a way to personalize the name for Player 2, 3 and 4 when there are 4 humans playing? We tried everything in the edit mode including tapping the name plate and nothing works to change the name. The names do change when they are computer players. If there is a way to change to names when in ""human"" mode, it is not intuitive. 3. As other players mentioned we do wish there was an option for a longer board. I like the short version that exists right now but when we have time for a longer game, another few routes would be great, with more house spaces, salary spaces and other perks. Does not seem to be very many house spaces, we've played many games when neither of us had more than one degree and both had zero houses. We do love the 2nd chance spots!! 4. The ""risk"" road seems boring since it's all Wheels of Fate with a few Taxes spots sandwiched in. We hate landing on a Wheel of Fate because we ALWAYS get Taxes. Also where is the reward for taking the risk? Would be nice to have a couple of very large financial gains on that street, like a $500k spot and a House Inheritance or something. How about a free scholarship for another degree? 5. Does it matter which spouse you choose if you go down the Marriage road? Are there advantages over one or the other? This isn't explained, unless there are no special advantages of one over another (there should be if there are not). I guess same thought on kids, are there advantages to having kids? If yes, what are they? 6. I would like to be able to pay back debt when I get paid my salary, that would be a nice ""pause"" option when cruising over a paycheck collection space. 7. It's nice having two career choices after completing an education purchase but we always take the higher paying job, why would we choose the other one? THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME GAME!!!

Do not waste your money buying this because all you get is the base level board. All other boards cost money, just like the first version of this game. Unless you're prepared to ultimately fork out around $50 which is the cost of a physical board game, this is not worth ANY money.

The gameplay is overall pretty fun with cute cinematics. The 1 thing I want is for the boards to be longer.,positive,0.517995297908783

Players would be like I need to get 20 wins so I can get a new map instead of being like I might play a round then play minecraft and get some rewards to get some more skins,positive,0.8944505453109741
