Vanessa Fundora,7/26/2020,In the Game of Life the first one the game play has many more options more styles and mini games this just isn't hitting the spot for me like the 1st one. Kinda regretting spending $4 on this game I hope they do some improvements. It says it has more choices than the 1st an it really doesn't I mean family wise the 1st one has children scattered around the board. I feel like the Board is shorter than the original one as well...I would like to know when I will get my refund back. Thank you,negative,0.8265432119369507
Masquerade PW,7/29/2021,"Fun but flawed. While the game is fun, it's hard to tell whether you're playing against AI or players. Frequently, you'll end up facing opponents who only get perfect rolls. This makes it frustrating to play because the RNG begins feeling incredibly lopsided. It's also tough to play with friends because you can't invite friends to matchmade sessions - if you want to play with your friends, you'll have to accept that your only other opponents will be the AI. Ultimately, I recommend the game",negative,0.8234171271324158
Mr. Cooper,2/9/2022,Problems: 1. 5x game speed resets every time a human player has a turn. 1x speed is far too slow even for a human player. 2. 5x game mode causes the game to regularly freeze. 3. There is no variation between maps other than the art. 4. 30 children requires too many replays of map to secure the collectible. The number required should be akin to the house requirement. 5. The intro should be skipable. 6. The computer AI too frequently makes poor decisions. 7. The spinner is RNG controlled.,negative,0.7791311144828796
Anna Johnson,8/23/2020,"For the first day I expected some glitchs when playing solo sometimes the AI glitches and freezes and multiplayer also happens when the screen freezes and won't let you choose options but this game is fun and obviously I don't expect it to be perfect when it's so new, please just take my experience into your concerns. edit: all of my concerns have been adressed and I no longer have those problems",negative,0.4154745936393738
Ryan Garner,10/1/2020,"Fun game to kill time, you can play solo vs Ai, online vs other people, or with a friend or three locally by just passing the phone or whatever back and forth. There are unlockable items from completing milestones that you can use to customize your little guy. Only knock I have on the game is that you cannot play on new maps without buying them, would be cool to have a way to unlock those for free somehow",positive,0.8717182874679565
Sierra,11/28/2020,"Got this during a sale and definitely am having fun with it! Games have a decent amount of time, you can play with AIs instead of having to play online with other people, and it seems well balanced so far. Will update if that changes! Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that in game purchases are extremely expensive. I saw a couple that are more than the game at full price! Definitely tone that down some. Maybe less for the different versions & have another pay option for different costumes?",positive,0.9595343470573425
David Askew,8/9/2020,"It's a fun game and I enjoy playing it. I was expecting more options and opportunities within the game to build up points (making it more real life). I actually think each game is too quick - its a shame there is not different options for game lengths. Also, not many people seem to use the online game facility - I often just get pitted against 2/3 automated players.",positive,0.9057603478431702
Veronica Petkau,11/25/2020,"Might increase rating later if they increase game play time. Honestly, as soon as you get into it - it ends! Other than that, it's a great version of the game. Love all the options like the 'child or pet' option is nice. When an AI player chose a pet before marriage they got a cat. Cat rides shotgun most of the game then player chose to have a '2nd Chance' wedding ... and their new spouse HAD TO SIT IN THE BACK SEAT xD hahahaha that's a little brutal but honest I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",positive,0.9220001101493835
Static Syndic8,7/16/2020,"I absolutely love this sequel! I really loved the original but this one is like 10x better! I would ask for 3 things though: 1) for purchases to be *slightly* cheaper 2) the ability to change your friends names in pass and play 3) and finally, the feature of kicking a player in online multiplayer if they are afk and replace them with a robot Besides that I love to see this game grow! <3",positive,0.978425145149231
Ryan L,12/19/2020,"In spite of other reviews that mention the cost of the game being pricey for one board, it's a good game. I think it's actually kind of reasonable considering the life physical board game gives you one board for -$20+. It's a fair price in my eyes. My fiancee and I enjoy passing the game to eachother and competing against the bots. She loved the life board game and got me into it, and this is even better!",positive,0.8550029397010803
Marky Mark,7/22/2020,"Only been playing for a few hours, but for $3.50 and no ads, with all the new additions, I can't complain much. Although, my only complaint thus far is that I'm fairly certain I'm playing with bots rather than actual people when playing online...I switched to another app on my phone several times during an online game, only to find the previous player still on their turn, on the exact same space they were when I changed to a different application..it should be made clear to us if they use bots.",neutral,0.4398311674594879
Cakey Online,4/3/2023,"I absolutely love this, and have now got all 3 of us siblings playing long distance using the in game cam and mic. It is just so easy to use and so much fun. And I'm addicted to playing against AI and unlocking all the stuff. Can see myself buying all the maps for sure",positive,0.9852091670036316
Charlie Hutchinson,11/6/2020,"Fun game, I like how you can play it offline with AI if you don't have data. Only giving 4 stars because for some reason I can't put it on my SD card or the game keeps crashing, this is the only game that does that. Asides from that fun game.",positive,0.8184604048728943
Jim McDowell,7/31/2021,Among the most unbalanced games I've ever tried to play. The ONLY time I spun anything higher than a 2 was when I only needed to move 1 space. Meanwhile the AI was spinning exactly what they needed 3 out of 4 times,negative,0.829578161239624
Neighbor Please,9/4/2020,"The AI kept taking forever to make a choice, spin ect. I had to keep going to the menu to either load or restart the game, or even close the app entirely. I'm not sure why this kept happening.",negative,0.8430574536323547
Jay Dautel,12/26/2020,idk if I just have the worst luck or what but the game feels really loaded in the ai's favor compared to the first one. Everytime you need the spinner for something it never gives you a chance to win. I have yet to get anything above 3rd place.,negative,0.9120827317237854
Rebecca Havko,11/26/2020,"You're wasting money if you buy this game. Every spin I made was terrible. Every time fate got to decide, I paid taxes. Every challenge against the ai, I lost, and they chose me for every challenge. Every time I got the slightest bit ahead in cash, I landed on taxes. I thought this would be fun and relaxing, but instead I feel angry and cheated. If you want to play life, buy the board game. At least then the computers can't cheat and you have a chance of having fun.",negative,0.9026266932487488
Caleb Perera,8/20/2021,"Multiplayer is better in the original GOL. In this one you can only invite friends and play with AI. In the original, you can invite a friend then search for other random people.",positive,0.6742284297943115
Grampy Roma,6/25/2021,I was excited to play this game online but once I pressed search I waited a long long while and it still didn't find anyone for me to play with. You also only get 1 map. In app purchases for the rest of the maps.,negative,0.7817138433456421
CJ Amused,12/2/2020,It's bit boring in single player waiting on the ai turns. It'd be nice to have more interactive options during that time.,negative,0.7783089280128479
Bryn pls,7/31/2020,how about adding the ability to add bots to a game? it makes it a little silly when there are three trophies to get when 2 players are fighting for 3 trophies. that are worth 400 points,negative,0.6547123193740845
Eric Snare,8/8/2020,"I went to play the game, paid for it, loades it, then I go to start it and it automatically kicks me out before any screen for the game comes on. Please look into this",negative,0.7602565288543701
Uasakura,11/4/2021,"Its an okay game, I wanted to play with real people, but i highly doubt the online mode are real people, they all seems like bot to me. Their name appears to be fake, and their reaction time are instant just like ai, tried online about 4 times, they spin and make decisions without even a second of reading....",negative,0.7575424313545227
C Singleton,10/14/2020,AI wins more than human players & it's not concise. Game tells you to pay loans before the end of the game but there's no selectable option to do so. Starting to hate I paid for this.,negative,0.8816285133361816
V Crowley,1/11/2023,very AI favored... the amount of low numbers you land on are ridiculous and repetitive.. and AI is slow ... this could have been a good game... just boring and waste of money,negative,0.9388334155082703
Kristy Langellier,4/27/2021,I love this game. It works perfectly in single player and is really fun. You can choose how many AI are in your game too.,positive,0.9841046929359436
Michael Peat,8/26/2022,"Good game to play when you're bored, but crashes too many times. Even when playing single player against the AI.",negative,0.6012738943099976
Daisy Flower,1/23/2023,Really good game. Love to play it with my friends and there is ai players if you want to play alone. Definitely worth it!,positive,0.9865086674690247
Dareece Luze,1/2/2022,We have an adaptive switch for my daughter with Cerebral Palsy. This game is perfect for us. So fun!,positive,0.98468416929245
