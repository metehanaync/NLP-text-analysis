Zoe Luce,9/28/2023,this is a really fun game with lots of potential.. but like.. you get one map and if you want other maps they're $5 a piece after already paying $3.99 for the game.. so as soon as you unlock your collectables on your one and only map it gets boring and you don't want to play anymore. Maps should be unlockable.. imo was super fun to play though reminds me of the old PlayStation game of life back in the day. Use to be my favorite.,positive,0.6803325414657593
Ashley M,4/29/2021,"I've been looking for a game that I can play that doesn't require coins or dumping money into it to keep going. This is the one. Really fun with length gameplay. Some people don't like the lack of character customization. I don't mind it too much, but that is one area of improvement I see. Can't complain much though - the lack of being bombarded with ads, no coins or timed rewards to play, id gladly pay .99 for a cute character outfit. Awesome job with this one!",positive,0.8710657358169556
Saigey Marie,5/31/2021,"The maps could be longer or have an option to switch to 1-5 instead of 1-10 to make it longer and be able to land on more spaces in the game. Could have added power ups or minigames to make it more interesting. The layout is the same in all of them, only the theme is different. I do like the ability to unlock more vehicles, outfits and portraits and the fact there is a nonbinary character. Overall the game is fun but it could be enhanced for better gameplay.",positive,0.6566812992095947
Nicholas R,9/1/2021,"It's a pretty decent mobile game to pass the time. No advertisements which is good since you have to pay money for it. It's a little small in content however. And pretty heavily focused on RNG. But it is modeled after The Game of Life board game which is entirely luck based. This, however, makes it annoying when trying to complete a specific challenge. You can go 4 games in a row and never have a baby just because of unlucky spins. Overall it's pretty good, but could definitely be improved upon",positive,0.6675873398780823
Kate Hoyt,8/4/2020,"The map is too short. In most of my playthroughs none of the players get a house, let alone buy and sell more than one. Seems like a waste of an idea since it's so rare to land on a house space. There are also many playthroughs without any pets or kids. The map is just too short to experience the content. Also each game has 4 players but there are only 3 different icons to choose. Other than that, it is fun!",negative,0.7936925292015076
Constance Fontenot,6/21/2021,I love everything about the game but I have a few problems. When playing by myself I literally just now have lost 10 times in a row from the bottom. Please fix. And I keep trying to land on family to complete one of the collections and with 10 games I haven't landed on family once even with risky route and everything. Please pay attention and try to fix. I will give it 5 stars cause other than that it's perfect!,negative,0.7675856351852417
Cierra Berrie,9/2/2020,I really enjoy this game! But with the update I lost all of my collectibles... Also seeing a longer game option would be wonderful! I enjoy the shorter board too but having that variety would be a lot of fun. More house spots and more job spots. Even so more risk. Maybe adding in a lose your job space(s) just to make things a little more interesting.,positive,0.9448887705802917
Chyanne DeLong,12/14/2020,Pay to play game 💰💰💰 If you have alot of money then you can really enjoy the app. Cause when I bought it I thought I would have gotten all of it but I was wrong. It includes season passes you can choose to pay. But the game gets boring once you finish the original one. Honestly it feels like the computer is not going getting to pay taxes or and is always getting high numbers and is always going first. It also seems that the computer ends up but gets money 💰 from me but not the taxes.,positive,0.8138478398323059
Rosemary Hernandez,10/24/2020,"If I would have known we only get to play 1 map and have to pay for the others, I would have never purchased this. It's a fun game, but i thought more maps would be become available over time for free or you have to gain puzzle pieces to get it. Something like that. I don't recommend if you only want to play 1 map or don't mind paying more for each map.",negative,0.6806058287620544
Wesley Coon,7/16/2020,I love this game so far! Couple of things though! 1) there needs to be a timer for when an online opponent takes too much time just to speed up the game. 2) I feel like different game modes would be an awesome way to kill time and earn prizes. If that's not possible I understand! Overall love the game and I hope to see some great improvements!!!,positive,0.9573578834533691
Ronnie Hulen,4/1/2023,"Really fun, idle type game. The transactions and bundles are set up beautifully! I didn't want the Frozen Lands bundle, but I really wanted the bear avatar; boom, 99¢ and I got the only thing I wanted, rather than having to fork over $4 for a bunch of things I don't. No ads, runs smoothly, fun challenges to earn free outfits and unlock things if you're a completionist. All around, my favorite game on my phone!",positive,0.9519745111465454
Fatima Gaskins,7/30/2021,"It's the game of life, but better. The reason for a low rating is that I paid $3.99 for it. Doesn't that mean I should be able to unlock new aspects of the game for free? Why is it $34.99 for all locked content at a ""steal"" of 73% off or $4.99 each? I have no problem paying for a great game, but that should come with a way to unlock all game content for free. If you want to microtransaction people do what other previously paid games (like Plants v. Zombies 2) did and become free.",negative,0.43540266156196594
Hannah Turner,11/25/2023,The game is awesome now the only thing I don't like is you have to pay $4.99 for other levels but the game is cool either way I love it and it was totally worth paying for. ☺ lol at least I don't have to hear my brother yell every time someone takes his money 😂 😂 😂 I play with computers,positive,0.8710113167762756

Xander Dascomb,10/3/2023,"I feel like the single player is lop side. Most of the time I roll low numbers, and lose the competitive rolls.

Queen Bee,9/28/2023,"Love this game, i have bought many worlds and play all the time with my friends on the pass and play option.

Dr Chocolate,7/25/2020,"Honestly not a bad game, I think they made some improvements that is a step in the right path. The only thing that is holding me back from giving 5 stars is that I wish the skip button isn't just 5 times speed and normal speed, 5 times is too fast to see anything, but normal is too slow and boring. Other than that, is game is awsome and I would recommend it.",positive,0.5474157929420471
Rob Cowden,10/28/2020,"Much better development, with it going along the old classic game. Like the path scenarios, but just as I was getting into it, it ended. Feel it should have been a longer running path. If you took the board length of the first version with the play format of the new version, you'll be definitely getting there. Update: After a few plays, have a couple of thoughts. Having children only gives you hearts, why no cash bonus at the retirement? The game ends should end on the round not a person.",positive,0.8117420673370361

Monkey Mallow (Monkimallow),1/24/2021,I own the first one on the computer as well and while I really enjoy the unlockables aspect and some of the other mechanics... we no longer get money for action cards collected or children. And of course the two mini-games are no where to be seen in this version of the game. I really enjoy the van mini-game and the 10 meter run one from the first one and think they would fit here too over just doing spins for the highest number.

Elizabeth Pringle,8/18/2020,"This version is so much better than the original! Theres much more freedom in how you play, so you're not really 'required' to get married and have children to win. It's more about the experiences you gather, so I won by staying single, buying my own apartment and adopting a cat and dog while studying for a masters degree!

Bekka Babcock,7/20/2020,Price was decent. I like the puzzle pieces but I see the same cards and jobs over and over so that tells me there isn't a lot of different choices or options with action cards or jobs.

Games have a decent amount of time, you can play with AIs instead of having to play online with other people, and it seems well balanced so far. Will update if that changes!

This game is just so easy I can say even a 5 yr old child can win every single time if he knows what to do. There are just too less variables in this game, it makes winning too easy.

Ryan Garvin,12/17/2021,"It's definitely not the best version of life but it's the best you can get on your phone. They really need to add an option to limit the rolls from 1-5, 1-6 or something less than 10. The board is so short and the games go so fast. There's never a chance to do anything. Being able to buy a house is so so rare because you are constantly skipping over all the opportunities.

Data Lore,7/19/2020,"The game is cute and interesting, but the progression is very short and linear. There isn't a lot of variety between each game and not picking college and the investing route just doesn't give you any true lasting rewards. The little extra points you collect aren't worth much and don't reward you for not taking the money routes. Overall the replayability of these very short matches is basically nonexistent.

If you're facing a crash issue, go the app setting (Android App Setting) and give it mic permission, if you are okay being recorded by a game app. Personally, I'm uninstalling and getting refund.

I just played and spun 3 or under 7 times in a row. I actually used to win games but have been 4th place (I do know how to place this game) the last several times I've played.

Shannon Sihtam,4/10/2021,Its not too bad but as many others mentioned you are paying for the original one only. They charge for everything else. I also think its a bit short.

Matrix -Mega,4/20/2022,This game is fun but there is actually no system that times out players when they go afk for large amounts of time. There has to be a system that will kick the player after like 2 minutes of inactivity.

Charles Hobbs,7/3/2022,It's a fun game but you have to spend a lot of money just to play on a different map. If you bought all the maps you be spending at least an extra 40 to 50 dollars.
