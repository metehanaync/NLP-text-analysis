DRG BS,7/17/2020,"It is ok, but here is an issue that I'd like to address for improvement. Online play is a disparaging experience. People tend to quit with no repercussions for it. The game is slow but with details, it is fine if people don't bail. You can tell a player quits when it takes 4 minutes for it to ""auto"" spin. Also, when a player has quit and lands on an action/event tile, the game stops progressing! Stuck until the ""player"" clicks an option. I waited for 20+ min. and the 2 choices were still there!",negative,0.8064666390419006
Saigey Marie,5/31/2021,"The maps could be longer or have an option to switch to 1-5 instead of 1-10 to make it longer and be able to land on more spaces in the game. Could have added power ups or minigames to make it more interesting. The layout is the same in all of them, only the theme is different. I do like the ability to unlock more vehicles, outfits and portraits and the fact there is a nonbinary character. Overall the game is fun but it could be enhanced for better gameplay.",positive,0.6566812992095947
Constance Fontenot,6/21/2021,I love everything about the game but I have a few problems. When playing by myself I literally just now have lost 10 times in a row from the bottom. Please fix. And I keep trying to land on family to complete one of the collections and with 10 games I haven't landed on family once even with risky route and everything. Please pay attention and try to fix. I will give it 5 stars cause other than that it's perfect!,negative,0.7675856351852417
Holly Hedges,3/16/2021,"Not worth it. You pay to download and if you want to open any more boards you have to pay for them. They should have made it so you unlock new boards as you accomplish tasks. I could understand paying for extras like avatars, outfits, and vehicles, but the boards shouldn't be a paid item. It was fun for the first couple of times, but it got boring really quickly. Unless you buy the new boards the game quickly loses its luster.",negative,0.7731763124465942
Wesley Coon,7/16/2020,I love this game so far! Couple of things though! 1) there needs to be a timer for when an online opponent takes too much time just to speed up the game. 2) I feel like different game modes would be an awesome way to kill time and earn prizes. If that's not possible I understand! Overall love the game and I hope to see some great improvements!!!,positive,0.9573578834533691
Fatima Gaskins,7/30/2021,"It's the game of life, but better. The reason for a low rating is that I paid $3.99 for it. Doesn't that mean I should be able to unlock new aspects of the game for free? Why is it $34.99 for all locked content at a ""steal"" of 73% off or $4.99 each? I have no problem paying for a great game, but that should come with a way to unlock all game content for free.

Edmin Rossy,9/1/2020,THE GAME OF LIFE 2 is by far the best board game on the market. The reason I give the game a 4 star is because It feels like it's watered down and extremely short. I would really love to see a longer board. I'm excited for the new road maps. As you can tell the biggest issue I have is the game feels extreamly short. Also the next update can you guys add more customization. Can we please have a LEADERBOARD üôè.

Chris Faulk,3/23/2023,I will agree with other reviews that the game mechanics are not at all random or fair. CPU very often gets high number spin or lands on the perfect spot or gets max value for house sale OR high salary OR lands on their own lucky number multiple times in a row. I just played and spun 3 or under 7 times in a row. I actually used to win games but have been 4th place (I do know how to place this game) the last several times I've played.

Tejpreet Mundi,1/11/2021,"Here are few suggestions to improve this game. 1: In game chat, emotes/taunts and voice chat with ability to mute players individually. Without them, the game feels boring without the social aspect. 2: Game feels too short sometimes. Maybe make another mode with more tiles, or more paths to choose from? 3: Jobs are almost always repetitive. I expected larger pool of jobs to choose from.

Do not waste your money buying this because all you get is the base level board. All other boards cost money, just like the first version of this game.

Valessie McAneny,2/16/2022,"So the game is good and I like that, but I'm extremely annoyed that I've paid ¬£6 to unlock the haunted Hills map and skins but when I play with friends or for others in my Google play family, it does not allow them to also see the map. Even when I host the game I expect the friends I'm playing with, or even those who yet again are on my family library, to be able to see the map. I'm not expecting them to be able to use the skins they've not paid for, but at least be able to see the map.",negative,0.5895060300827026
