Zayn Cheadle,10/21/2023,I love the game it has a few tweaks though hoping they can fix those but over all amazing. game especially for the price,positive,0.9515587687492371
Acliptic,7/20/2020,"So Having just played my first game prior to writing this review it was amazing the gameplay is incredible There was just one small problem and this is why I'm leaving 4 starts After accidently pressing the settings button I obviously pressed ""Resume"" but the banner that drops done when pressing settings got stuck halfway up the screen. So this meant I couldn't read the information that drops down at the end. So I thought Id write a review to let the Devs know (picture is available on request)",positive,0.7296366691589355
Terri Charlton,8/23/2020,"Game constantly freezes! I have missed many of the final scores due to the game freezing. When it freezes during gameplay, I can save and quit and return but the final score is pretty important and it won't allow me to save and return at that point.",negative,0.918840229511261
jessica caves,7/15/2020,"After pointing out a few issues and the prompt and useful response of the developers I have changed my score to 5 stars. This is a brilliant family game that is easy to use, and with the different game modes (single, pass the phone and online) there is a way to play for everyone. I love the diversity and the fact this classic game has been brought into the 21st century to be more inclusive. Well done team üòÄ",positive,0.9538216590881348
Shannon Sihtam,4/10/2021,Its not too bad but as many others mentioned you are paying for the original one only. They charge for everything else. I also think its a bit short. I think they should have options for longer or shorter games and more than 4 people. I also agree there's a lot of repetition so I would like to see a bit more diversity in the content.,negative,0.6366464495658875
Jinxie Joelle,12/31/2022,"Addictive game but many bug issues and drains the battery quick , put my phone to charge as I been playing more then 30 minutes and my battery went from 88% to 12% , I even had it on charge and my phone become hot with less battery percentage at 6% üò≥and my friend experienced the same issue.... also should be and kick out or reload player options for players that don't press ready or lose connection when joining online.. otherwise I would say 5 stars .. please look into this issue. Regards",negative,0.8916573524475098
Holly Bunn,8/10/2020,While playing the game it freezes and I have to exit out and get back into the game even than it freezes about 4 more times before I can finish the game I love the game when it freezes on single player mode (waiting for a player) it makes me not want to play it anymore,negative,0.8847737312316895
Lady Burst,7/13/2021,"First of all it lost all my progress,has no button to contact support . i had to buy the game twice! And ive lost so many unlockables and 30 or more so dollars! Update! I contacted support they told me there is no way or restoring it nor giving me my money back. So if i wish to get back to where i was ill need to invest 20 hours or game time and give them more money for something i paid for. Super greedy!",negative,0.927284836769104
joey chung,10/2/2021,"This game is not allowing Online with Friend function the second time when i open this game! Whats going on?? Can adminstrator fix this?? ( I had the exact same problem with Monopoly, and it was fixed a week later after I left feedback like this. Hopefully it works again!) Thanks",negative,0.741352379322052
Al Henderson,2/10/2021,The thing is it's the same old same old. Even if you pay to buy a different quote on quote game it's still the same questions is still the same game so why do I want to spend $5 to be in Fairland or whatever they need to come up with a new and more exciting reason to pay for those new games. Maybe it's just me but new outfits a new vehicle to drive don't really excite me,negative,0.7784069180488586
ron gerhart,10/21/2020,"The game has improved in stability, but it gets boring fast unless your willing to spend money to get add ons. I find that Part messed up since you have to spend money on the game then money on add ons.",negative,0.7987884879112244
Yong hwee TAN,11/22/2021,Game play is good but it was really disappointing to know that we have to pay for additional maps and feels like it's way overprice. Even more expensive then purchasing the apps itself.,negative,0.9003598690032959
Megan Gettens,7/10/2021,"The game is amusement enough, however after paying for the game you are then expected to purchase further in app expenses. What's worst, is that I paid for the season pass to access all extra content, to play with my daughter using family library, but the extra content didn't carry over to her game and was hence an absolute waste of money.",negative,0.7254254817962646
Gary ‚ÄúTheGuru423‚Äù Lee,9/11/2020,Not one single complaint!!!! Thank you so much! Although I'm sure everyone will agree when I say this; We'd all be extremely gratuitous and also more inclined to purchase the other various content if you'd give us more than the basics on a new game we purchased!,positive,0.9696574211120605
James Van cliff,5/30/2022,First time playing one of these game and i have to say i love it but the there is prices for other boards and i said how if i buy a game should have the full game but to tell the truth i have actually bought space boards and some other bits like cars and people i see myself buying all of this in small chunks as the environment are nice and each board have mission and i pkayed online such a great game im uping my 4 stars to a 5 stars im hooked to your game play every single day and night.,positive,0.9435634016990662
Kevin Dlst,8/11/2020,"i thought i bought a full game, there's more 'Worlds' or simply maps to unlock; the only way to unlock is to buy again. not to mention there's this Seasonal Pass which is like what the heck i just bought for? for more buys? your trailers not telling me that there's still more buys inside the game, all i know i just bought a game and it's not full. what a shame, i wanna refund",negative,0.7415441274642944
Heru Khuti,12/1/2020,"Coming up as a kid this was one of my favorite board games, use to play it on the board, my playstation or computer it did'nt matter lol,so it's always good to tap back in bringing back the good ole memories lol I always loved this game.",positive,0.9737246632575989
Melissa Childress,7/7/2022,I don't think that it's fair to charge for the base game and not include the extras. It's a pretty expensive game once you've added in the other themes,negative,0.7578210234642029
Brandy Crise,10/21/2021,"Not the game experience I remember. It's short, crazy expensive paywall, missing important game mechanics, and over simplified.",negative,0.929344892501831
Izel Barzilay,9/24/2021,I bought the game but online multiplayer and online with friends options are non existent. I see the buttons but it can not be clicked. How can I solve this?,negative,0.7402618527412415
Dee Dra,10/16/2020,I like this game and all but the only question I have is how in the world do you repay loans back before you retire??? Will put 5 stars if my question gets aswered thanks Edit: thank you for getting back to me! That was driving me crazy trying to figure it out!!,positive,0.6882963180541992
Abbey Bint,3/12/2022,"A very nice game so far! I've played one game and it's really fun, I highly recommend definitely worth the money and I'm happy there are no ads atm :))",positive,0.9891091585159302
Nicole Thompson,1/3/2021,"Just downloaded the game and I can only use the app until the game goes to load (single, multiplayer, press and play have all been tried) and then the app shuts off",negative,0.667613685131073
Christy Schrader,3/17/2022,Love the game. Just wish expansions weren't more expensive than what I paid for the game.,positive,0.9005839228630066
Trevor Pellegrini,9/7/2021,Not a bad game but wouldn't hurt to do some occasional updates. Bought this back in 2019 and no updates since.,neutral,0.49855127930641174
jason eric Hawkins,8/28/2020,"I love this game, but after a while of course it gets a little bland, & sometimes it runs a little slow, thank you all for this",positive,0.7039040327072144
Dylan Du toit,10/2/2023,Hi can I please have a refund? The game is fantastic but I just don't play it anymore,negative,0.4944191575050354
Mike Flores,8/19/2020,Please update the game board and add new features PLEASE. it's already a boring game to play and I'm NOT paying for another game :/,negative,0.9410620331764221
