Ashley M,4/29/2021,"I've been looking for a game that I can play that doesn't require coins or dumping money into it to keep going. This is the one. Really fun with length gameplay. Some people don't like the lack of character customization. I don't mind it too much, but that is one area of improvement I see. Can't complain much though - the lack of being bombarded with ads, no coins or timed rewards to play, id gladly pay .99 for a cute character outfit. Awesome job with this one!",positive,0.8710657358169556
K S,9/5/2020,"Meh...I like some of the options they've added like adopting pets and the gender neutral character, the option not to get married, but there just doesn't seem to be as much variety or as many options as the first one. It just kind of feels extended and dragged out. The only thing you really work at is getting the achievements. Graphics are better of course but not really enough to grab me. Played it a couple of time to see if it got more interesting. Nope. Get #1 if you want to play.",negative,0.6153126358985901
Miranda Danforth,1/30/2021,"I wish there were more board options without having to buy an add-on, it's gets a little repetitive. That being said I really enjoy the game, no issues with connecting to other players online. My daughter and I love to play the pass it mode a lot too. I love the new outfits and such that you can earn like little achievements. It's basically a faster version of the old school board game.",positive,0.7763086557388306
April Sherman,6/9/2021,"Awesome graphics. However I just downloaded the game today and it's already buggy. It started freezing up repeatedly in a game to the point where I had to exit least twice to get the game going, and then finally I wasn't even giving the option to exit anymore and I had to shut the app down and reopen. That caused me to lose the remainder of the game.",negative,0.9253332614898682
Nicholas R,9/1/2021,"It's a pretty decent mobile game to pass the time. No advertisements which is good since you have to pay money for it. It's a little small in content however. And pretty heavily focused on RNG. But it is modeled after The Game of Life board game which is entirely luck based. This, however, makes it annoying when trying to complete a specific challenge. You can go 4 games in a row and never have a baby just because of unlucky spins. Overall it's pretty good, but could definitely be improved upon",positive,0.6675873398780823
Mischa Bodenschatz,5/28/2022,"I really enjoy the game. The only problems I have is that I can no longer play on my switch, and on my phone the maps cost money. When I try to play on the switch the map turns purple, and all I can see is the cards. Please fix this glitch. And if it is not to much make a 4 dollar expansion pack of all the maps. Make the separately maps 1 dollar each. That will get you a lot more buys. Other than these two things the game is amazing.",negative,0.6806155443191528
Reiko Aburame\Breezy Bree,1/31/2021,"The game is excellent, the graphics are great, everything pretty much is good except for multiplayer when someone is taking too long. Is there a way you can kick them from the game or they get kicked out because it halters the game significantly when you have to wait for a very slow person (looking at you McDino).",positive,0.7870796322822571
Laura Herman,2/18/2022,"I love it! It's much more fun and enjoyable than the board game, plus there's online multiplayer too, which makes it that much better. However, there is a bug I noticed... Often, in online multiplayer, when someone chooses a job, the game shows the one they didn't pick when it decides their number, it can get confusing. Other than that, it's an amazing game! I purchased the season pass and I don't regret it!",positive,0.9654927849769592
Ronnie Hulen,4/1/2023,"Really fun, idle type game. The transactions and bundles are set up beautifully! I didn't want the Frozen Lands bundle, but I really wanted the bear avatar; boom, 99Â¢ and I got the only thing I wanted, rather than having to fork over $4 for a bunch of things I don't. No ads, runs smoothly, fun challenges to earn free outfits and unlock things if you're a completionist. All around, my favorite game on my phone!",positive,0.9519745111465454
Lisa Piel-Jackson,10/7/2023,"I bought the app, which I rarely do, thinking of how much I used to love playing Life. Then I find out you only get one map and have to pay for any extras. Absolutely no way to earn them, it's pay real money or nothing. Total scam in my opinion. The game seems fun and graphics are cute but I don't need an app that is just a money pit. Returning it!",negative,0.8370701670646667
Nick Smith,10/28/2023,"Not worth the money. $3.99 to download and you only get access to one board. It's $4.99 each for the other boards.

Katelyn Leslie,8/29/2023,I'm really disappointed in this app. I love the board game growing and was hoping this would be as enjoyable now that it's harder to find people to play the actual board game with. It's not. I feel like I wasted my money buying this because the game play time is too short. You don't have the options you do with the board game. It's really rather boring. I would love a more detailed game board that has more choices and events like insurance etc. And longer like the actual physical game.,negative,0.8843153119087219
Ambrosia Straub,6/27/2023,"I love the difference between the original and this one and really enjoyed playing. I then purchased the fairytale, started a new game, and was so excited to see the cool new gameboard! The 1st player landed on an action space and that's where the disappointment set in. The action cards are the same as in the basic version! I did enjoy seeing the careers are all new, but it's disappointing to see the same old action cards that I'm already bored with that don't have anything to do with fairytales",positive,0.9693782925605774
B Patel,10/20/2020,"After purchasing the app, I did not know I would only able to play one map. For other maps I have to pay extra - double than the purchased app. Don't purchase the app unless you want to play with one map only. There are plenty of free apps in the market rather than wasting money on it. Edit:Awesome! The team is working hard to resolve the bugs. Everything looks good except minor bugs. When the bot selectes the career, it represents alternative selction done by bot to the users.",neutral,0.45608770847320557

Jess Boggs,3/13/2021,"Not bad, some action cards are repetitive as mentioned, I kinda hoped the mini games were actual games and not just spinning the wheel. I got this on sale, however I do wish there was a way you could gain access to the new lands versus just having to keep paying. Update: purchased a new world and all this game really has to offer (for the price of $7 CAD) is different cars, avatar picture and outfits for character. The game play itself gets boring and doesn't really change from world to world.",negative,0.5430302023887634
Brittany Lafferty,7/16/2023,The game was fun up until the recent update I guess...now It tells me my device no longer supports the app. How do you change it from a system you already had to pay to play it to begin with ??,negative,0.7529770135879517
Jarne Vercammen,11/30/2020,It's a great game. The controls are nice and they even added a option for a purple peg indicating non-binary people what is already a step up from the first game of life. But the game of life always has been about the money how much you have art he end and this version kinda defeats the purpose by adding other points. Also for already being a payed game I find it a bit weird to have to pay 10 bucks to get the full experience. For the rest solid game.,positive,0.9032875895500183
Sarah Holt,9/16/2020,"If you like playing the board game, then you will like this version. You have multiple options to play, individual, pass to a friend, even online against other players.

Nothing changed by doing that.,negative,0.8372220993041992
Elizabeth Pringle,8/18/2020,"This version is so much better than the original! Theres much more freedom in how you play, so you're not really 'required' to get married and have children to win. It's more about the experiences you gather, so I won by staying single, buying my own apartment and adopting a cat and dog while studying for a masters degree! It feels more satisfying, so I started playing making my own choices, instead of tactically deciding how I can get more stuff!",positive,0.9373134970664978
Taylor Baldwin,8/5/2020,"Great so far! The graphics are awesome. The little pegs of people and animals are adorable and still board game feeling! The only thing from 5 stars is...

Anthony D,9/28/2020,Game can be fun. Too short of a board as far as game play. It's upsetting to pay for it only to open it up and find there is another board completely hidden behind a pay wall that's more expensive than the game itself..?..cosmetics are a little pricey for what you get too in my opinion. Otherwise than that I've enjoyed what I've played,negative,0.659576952457428
PhsycoRobloxian,2/26/2021,"YESSS this game is soo good. It basically really really fun and even when you don't win, you get some good collectibles along the way to customise yourself. I am like, about 40 collectibles now. I just need 8 more to maximize it and maybe I can buy the other maps to get some pretty new collectibles for my character design.

Pork Chopper,6/8/2021,It's the Game of Life. If you've played the board game you know roughly what to expect. It's got one really big problem though. The maps are comically short. I get it. Some mobile gamers want quick experiences. But there should be an option. A longer map and a shorter map. I've played a few games but I honestly don't think I'll be going back because it's too short to be enjoyable.,negative,0.7200700640678406

tazdevil335,1/2/2021,The game is a classic and if that's what you are looking for you may enjoy the game for 5 minutes. The game title makes the game sound like they added a ton of new features and better gameplay. However its the same exact game as the first just for more money. They even make you pay for the game and then try charging you in game purchases to get the addition maps for more money. The paid version is fun for about 5 minutes before It gets repetitive. When asking for a refund after it was denied.,positive,0.8424079418182373
pylod two,7/30/2020,"It's the same Game of Life we've come to expect and love. But this time around, there are more variables to consider, more thoughtful decisions needs to be made. Despite those changes, its still fun to play, and still simple to understand its mechanics. Overall, it has better gameplay and deserves a 5-star rating. I also love the fact that it can be played on Samsung Dex, giving me an opportunity to see and enjoy the rich 3D in-game environment on a 40 inch large screen without any lags.",positive,0.8995972871780396
Angel Smith,4/3/2022,"This game could be more fun if like someone said, there were longer boards. It does feel too short at times. But my main hangup is that this game freezes way too much.

Or at least no more than a few dollars for the whole thing (all expansion packs included).",negative,0.8266943097114563

Emily Groberski,8/9/2021,"One of my favorite Game of Life adoptions. The different boards are super neat and I love the different outfits. Totally worth it to buy the season pass. I do agree that it feels odd to charge for the base game and then make people pay for the different unlocks, but it keeps me entertained as well as something to do to pass the time with the kids while we're waiting in line or on long car rides.",positive,0.9773739576339722
Aliff Suhaimi,11/28/2020,"I bought this game during a sale for MYR 1.00. It is a good game and I really adore it. The game itself looks clean and simple. The customization is limited but sufficient. The gameplay is interesting as it really made me rethink of my life decisions. There are no bugs or crashes yet. Overall, it gets two thumbs up from me.",positive,0.9810112118721008
Hillary D.,1/2/2021,Wonderful game and beautifully illustrated. Highly recommend if you like the classic board game. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it won't let me use the 'online multi-player' because it says I don't have an internet connection when I do (wifi). I don't have an unlimited data plan so that's not an option for me... And I feel like for the price of the game it should let me connect via wifi.,positive,0.5039771199226379
Quality Girl,4/26/2021,"I would rate this a five star if they have more of a variety of characters, etc. To choose from. Otherwise this game is awesome if you really love The Game of Life.

Nathan Hill,7/16/2020,Playing the single player game works really good and it is fun. I do wish to see cars from basic look then look better while progressing like in the first one. UPDATE: Multi-player works wonder. I did not try marriage in my last review nor tried to grow a family so I did not know the vehicle grows at all until last night. I would love to see more upgrading the vehicle and I want to see a vintage pack like from the first game. I really love those old vehicles in those times.

newleif 97,8/31/2020,"Â£30 season pass for a one time purchase is ridiculous. I already paid Â£4.99 for a game with no free trial or demo just misleading adverts instead. Its far too short. No overall reward at all so its pointless comtinuing playing when you are already loosing. You should be able to win coins and gems to spend in a shop for more outfits etc. And have a leaderboard. Needs a chat option its so boring otherwise, people take too long. Apart from that its pointless playing with no overall reward or board",negative,0.8881868124008179
Jon S,2/14/2021,"It's well done but I wish that I could unlock new outfits by just playing and unlocking them, rather than have to pay microtransactions. I'd get it if the game was free but I paid for this. Given, its just aesthetics, but its just annoying. 90 percent of the enjoyment I get out of games is unlocking things and its hard to come by with phone games. But it's a fun game, I'd reccomend it.

Daniel Ray,10/3/2022,"My family has really been enjoying this game, and we really like the fact that a Facebook account isn't required to play with each other. The only suggestion we have is that it would be nice to have the option for a longer game. Sometimes the game seems very short. Which is fine sometimes, however, a longer game would allow more time to achieve objectives such as buying a house, getting a family with children and pet (it's hard enough sometimes just getting one let alone multiple), etc.",positive,0.9070155620574951
John Dean,8/13/2020,"I would give this game 5 stars for playability but for a 4 dollar game, the amount of paid add-ons is insane. $30 for a season pass?!? Apex Legends and games alike don't charge nearly that much and add incentives to the pass. Player skins should be unlockable by player currency that could be implemented in the game but they want to charge $1 for a peg with clothes on it. I much prefer the original game of life. The only redeeming factor is that it is playable online with friends.",negative,0.5558388829231262
Erin Yell,4/6/2022,"It's fun enough, I suppose. I really wish that there were different color options for our skin aside from pink, blue, and purple. I don't like that they're indicative of gender. I like the light blue a lot, but it's sad I can't wear a dress on my wedding day. The board is the exact same no matter what expansion you choose, so it can feel a bit boring at times. Rolling high numbers is the worst because the board is so short. I wish that there were randomized maps, so its new(ish) every game.",negative,0.4615682065486908
Cruors,8/19/2020,"Not a bad game but I feel the season pass is not worth it, they need to actually change the card/job/properties to the theme too so really brings the quality up and the excitement/discovery to the board way up instead of it just being a board skin and a song mostly which only makes you feel passive about it and doesn't change the game all that much for it to be worth it, my friends were disappointed. Adding new cards to the deck would also be nice too for such a steep price tag for skins.",negative,0.831623911857605
Melissa Torres,8/9/2020,"My 7-year old and I love playing the game! The graphics are great and she loves seeing what happens when she makes different life choices. With that said: 1. We would like to see at least 4 different player tokens so there are not 4 wheels, skateboards or birds when looking at the aerial view of the game board. Once a token is selected, it can't be used by another player. 2. Is there a way to personalize the name for Player 2, 3 and 4 when there are 4 humans playing? We tried everything in the edit mode including tapping the name plate and nothing works to change the name. The names do change when they are computer players. If there is a way to change to names when in ""human"" mode, it is not intuitive. 3. As other players mentioned we do wish there was an option for a longer board. I like the short version that exists right now but when we have time for a longer game, another few routes would be great, with more house spaces, salary spaces and other perks. Does not seem to be very many house spaces, we've played many games when neither of us had more than one degree and both had zero houses. We do love the 2nd chance spots!! 4. The ""risk"" road seems boring since it's all Wheels of Fate with a few Taxes spots sandwiched in. We hate landing on a Wheel of Fate because we ALWAYS get Taxes. Also where is the reward for taking the risk? Would be nice to have a couple of very large financial gains on that street, like a $500k spot and a House Inheritance or something. How about a free scholarship for another degree? 5. Does it matter which spouse you choose if you go down the Marriage road? Are there advantages over one or the other? This isn't explained, unless there are no special advantages of one over another (there should be if there are not). I guess same thought on kids, are there advantages to having kids? If yes, what are they? 6. I would like to be able to pay back debt when I get paid my salary, that would be a nice ""pause"" option when cruising over a paycheck collection space. 7. It's nice having two career choices after completing an education purchase but we always take the higher paying job, why would we choose the other one? THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME GAME!!!

First of all purchasing this will only get you 1 board and 1 set of tokens if you want to get more boards and tokens you have to get them separately or in small bundles or buy the season pass which gives you access to all of their current and future boards and tokens.
