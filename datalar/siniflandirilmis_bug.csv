Adam Taylor,6/20/2021,"You get 1 map, then have to pay for each map after. Spinner is not actually random. I've tested this, and the spinner will only give you certain numbers, based on your choice at the stops. The computer characters make terrible choices, yet are very ""lucky"" when it comes to landing on the spot they need. You usually win the game, but this game is full of errors. You also spend more time waiting for the other characters to finish, than anything else. This could be a great game,",negative,0.4618437886238098
DRG BS,7/17/2020,"It is ok, but here is an issue that I'd like to address for improvement. Online play is a disparaging experience. People tend to quit with no repercussions for it. The game is slow but with details, it is fine if people don't bail. You can tell a player quits when it takes 4 minutes for it to ""auto"" spin. Also, when a player has quit and lands on an action/event tile, the game stops progressing! Stuck until the ""player"" clicks an option. I waited for 20+ min. and the 2 choices were still there!",negative,0.8064666390419006
April Sherman,6/9/2021,"Awesome graphics. However I just downloaded the game today and it's already buggy. It started freezing up repeatedly in a game to the point where I had to exit least twice to get the game going, and then finally I wasn't even giving the option to exit anymore and I had to shut the app down and reopen. That caused me to lose the remainder of the game.",negative,0.9253332614898682
Laura Herman,2/18/2022,"I love it! It's much more fun and enjoyable than the board game, plus there's online multiplayer too, which makes it that much better. However, there is a bug I noticed... Often, in online multiplayer, when someone chooses a job, the game shows the one they didn't pick when it decides their number, it can get confusing. Other than that, it's an amazing game! I purchased the season pass and I don't regret it!",positive,0.9654927849769592
Holly Hedges,3/16/2021,"Not worth it. You pay to download and if you want to open any more boards you have to pay for them. They should have made it so you unlock new boards as you accomplish tasks. I could understand paying for extras like avatars, outfits, and vehicles, but the boards shouldn't be a paid item. It was fun for the first couple of times, but it got boring really quickly. Unless you buy the new boards the game quickly loses its luster.",negative,0.7731763124465942
Misty Roop,5/1/2022,"The only way to win the game is to choose to stay single and take the investment route. If you get married and go the family route, you lose every time. I also felt that it could last longer. The board seems much shorter, and there is not very much variety between the life cards or job cards. They are very repetitive. Too many things have been changed in not so good ways in my opinion. It's a poor sequel to a great classic game.",negative,0.6742482781410217
B Patel,10/20/2020,"After purchasing the app, I did not know I would only able to play one map. For other maps I have to pay extra - double than the purchased app. Don't purchase the app unless you want to play with one map only. There are plenty of free apps in the market rather than wasting money on it. Edit:Awesome! The team is working hard to resolve the bugs. Everything looks good except minor bugs.

You get a few small collectibles but if you want to change the board or anything to do with the game its extra. I paid for the game, I'd like everything in it. The cut scenes in the pass and play mode are too slow, the game has 1 clear winning path every time you play, college>invest>house>safe(anything else loses).

Caleb Whiting,1/20/2021,"Great game with solid replayability, but caught me off guard with misleading in app purchases. I bought one of the ""new worlds"" to play with my girlfriend only to discover that it only changes the cosmetic appearance without altering the original board in any way. Advertised as ""new worlds, visuals and cosmetics"", you would expect an entire new board rather than a skin. I would typically request a refund, however, the game is still enjoyable and I wish the developers all the best.",negative,0.59113609790802
Masquerade PW,7/29/2021,"Fun but flawed. While the game is fun, it's hard to tell whether you're playing against AI or players. Frequently, you'll end up facing opponents who only get perfect rolls. This makes it frustrating to play because the RNG begins feeling incredibly lopsided. It's also tough to play with friends because you can't invite friends to matchmade sessions - if you want to play with your friends, you'll have to accept that your only other opponents will be the AI. Ultimately, I recommend the game",negative,0.8234171271324158
Vero Rodriguez,7/21/2020,Fun! It's very fun to play and it is so awesome. You put a lot of effort into this and I love it. Though there is a problem. I'm multiplayer some people never ready up.

Apparently there's not many players who use it anyway, however that might be too do with the connection issues. The game is also very quick, and there is not a big variety of cards.

Pork Chopper,6/8/2021,It's the Game of Life. If you've played the board game you know roughly what to expect. It's got one really big problem though. The maps are comically short. I get it. Some mobile gamers want quick experiences. But there should be an option. A longer map and a shorter map.

Brittany Michael,7/15/2020,Alright. Could be improved by fixing the big where you must press FF5x every time anything changes in the change (very annoying).

tazdevil335,1/2/2021,The game is a classic and if that's what you are looking for you may enjoy the game for 5 minutes. The game title makes the game sound like they added a ton of new features and better gameplay. However its the same exact game as the first just for more money. They even make you pay for the game and then try charging you in game purchases to get the addition maps for more money. The paid version is fun for about 5 minutes before It gets repetitive.

I'd get it if the game was free but I paid for this. Given, its just aesthetics, but its just annoying. 90 percent of the enjoyment I get out of games is unlocking things and its hard to come by with phone games. But it's a fun game, I'd reccomend it.

Sorry but that's not gonna happen. I'm fine with having some microtransactions to get customizations and what not (like you have) but not with having to pay for 10 out of 11 maps (that will be released in the future).
