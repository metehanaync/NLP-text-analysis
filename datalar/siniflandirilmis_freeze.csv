Sammy Rivera,9/21/2023,"It's a very fun game very much like the game of life, you can also play online multiplayer which is amazing, and there's pass and play so you can play it without buying the board game!",positive,0.9866744875907898
Kaylin F,1/10/2021,Game is okay but for the price I wouldn't really say worth it. Its very short and I have had it freeze on me 3 or 4 times. When it freezes you miss out on some in game stuff and it just jumps to your turn so you don't really know what happened. It has a bunch of potential but I wouldn't say its worth the money at this point. Make the board longer or at least give the option for a longer board and work out the little kinks and it would definitely be a great game,negative,0.7220203876495361
Mr. Cooper,2/9/2022,Problems: 1. 5x game speed resets every time a human player has a turn. 1x speed is far too slow even for a human player. 2. 5x game mode causes the game to regularly freeze. 3. There is no variation between maps other than the art. 4. 30 children requires too many replays of map to secure the collectible. The number required should be akin to the house requirement. 5. The intro should be skipable. 6. The computer AI too frequently makes poor decisions. 7. The spinner is RNG controlled.,negative,0.7791311144828796
Erik Hunt (whiskyjacked),6/23/2021,"Kinda fun, but you have to buy more maps...after buying the game!! What a joke! I can understand having to unlock more maps/boards but not having to BUY them all. And the game is pretty fun, but $35 on sale is what it costs on top of the game purchase to unlock the other boards. Shameful. Update!: It also loves to randomly freeze up completely!",negative,0.8590759634971619
Shana King,3/14/2022,Fun but the game keeps freezing and I have to hit save and quit to get it to unfreeze. Once it froze right at the end though when it was determining the winner and I had to force course and that game progress was lost. Now I'm having it so that it will randomly shut down completely and close the game on me. I was hoping to not have any issues but I'm not willing to buy the expansions as is right now.,negative,0.8878269195556641
Angel Smith,4/3/2022,"This game could be more fun if like someone said, there were longer boards. It does feel too short at times. But my main hangup is that this game freezes way too much. And it's not even my phone. I know ppl on other phones that it happens to. Shame but I really feel this should be free. Or at least no more than a few dollars for the whole thing (all expansion packs included).",negative,0.8266943097114563
Breyden Coates,4/1/2021,Occasionally the game just freezes and you have to close the app to fix this. It's happened 5 times on the final point screen and I didn't get to see the points or who won. I've only had game a day. If it weren't for the freezes this would be a great app.,negative,0.8091737627983093
J Ahn,9/17/2020,Fun game but freezes too much. Well not so much as completely frozen but it will not progress at times. Animation and sound still works but nothing happens until I restart the App. Edit: I cleared my cache and no longer had this issue. Not sure if its the app or my phone but will update if I encounter freezes again.,negative,0.7608919739723206
Alex Wawroski,2/15/2022,"A whole lot of fun, and surprisingly charming art and animation! I don't recommend the 5x speed up option because it causes freezes, but you can just minimize the number of opponents to speed things up instead.",positive,0.8526390194892883
Saltiest Meatball,1/25/2021,"Deapite having a top of the line phone and 5G/1GB Wifi, the game still refuses to play well. Constantly freezes either during the game or during the score tallying, forcing you to void the whole game. Happens basically every other game. I would vote 0 stars if I could. Poor optimization.",negative,0.9242299795150757
Terri Charlton,8/23/2020,"Game constantly freezes! I have missed many of the final scores due to the game freezing. When it freezes during gameplay, I can save and quit and return but the final score is pretty important and it won't allow me to save and return at that point.",negative,0.918840229511261
Evan Tolstov,10/3/2020,"This is a great game. However, it tends to freeze up on my turn quite a bit. It'll just keep being stuck in the screen until enough time passes when the game will play for me, at which point all I have left to do is just exit the game. It's a fun game, but it's sad that this is an issue. It keeps happening pretty often.",negative,0.7847111821174622
Stephen Callans,10/28/2020,The game is pretty fun. I bought the package with all the boards and now it won't let me play the single player mode. I have to pass and play or play online. Can you fix this? Update: had to uninstall and then reinstall he game. Works ok now. Does freeze from time to time. Not sure why. Pretty fun though.,positive,0.4364151656627655
Tejas Karandikar,1/20/2021,"The game is great but the only issues are that the game sometimes freezes and lags at most of the stages... Also the original way of spinning the dial should be brought back in order to decide who plays first... Other features that need to be introduced are, actual players in single mode by random matching and also more worlds, but for free...",negative,0.6520180702209473
Holly Bunn,8/10/2020,While playing the game it freezes and I have to exit out and get back into the game even than it freezes about 4 more times before I can finish the game I love the game when it freezes on single player mode (waiting for a player) it makes me not want to play it anymore,negative,0.8847737312316895
Amanda Rok,8/3/2020,"What a waste of money. Game worked perfectly when I was getting my ass kicked. As soon as I waa going to win a single game, it froze after showing money earned and didn't progress to points earned or who won the game. I do not give negative reviews often, but I also do not spend money on games often. Don't waste your money!!!",negative,0.8780505657196045
Shelley Balsley,11/30/2020,The game keeps freezing up and I have to quit and then load save game. Beyond that the game could be a little more animated with the choices. I would have rated the game a 3 or 4 if it would quit freezing though.,negative,0.8195737600326538
Kookie's cookie,8/13/2021,"Game is great and so fun. However, lately, my single games keep freezing and I don't get anything from them. Even if I ""Save and Leave"" when I get back it opens a new game and all the progress is gone. I hope this issue can be solved so I can play.",negative,0.7570011615753174
Bhutwheyt Therismor,9/26/2021,"I had it at two because it wouldn't stop freezing, then it froze three more times in a row. A friend of mine is having the same issue. I don't like that I payed for something that doesn't work. If it gets fixed I'll buy the season pass, but it's unplayable until then.",negative,0.9254325032234192
Colleen Trump,8/15/2021,"The game freezes constantly. You can't get to any other boards unless you pay. I thought maybe you could when you win all the collectibles, but that doesn't do anything at all. Pretty disappointing considering I had to pay for this app.",negative,0.9154742956161499
Caleb Carr (Teaer),8/2/2020,"Game constantly freezes on other players loading screens. The puzzle pieces for creating a family is hard to complete, since landing on those squares is hard. The fantasy board needs more immersion. Game is fun when it is working.",negative,0.5650094151496887
F. PWALYM,4/19/2021,"This is good, but can you make it more complex like The Game of Life (1998)?? Also the game is so often to freeze, especially after a player/computer moves... Fix this please... Or can you make New Version of the game?? With the same energy just Like ""The Game of Life (1998)"" on Playstation One/PSX....",negative,0.45427846908569336
Pam tatum,6/24/2023,"It's a fun game me and my family play it on family night, but we are unable to change our names in the game it just says ""Player""",positive,0.819510281085968
Caleb Carter,2/2/2021,Game freezes (I'm literally on a new generation phone) constantly and it's repetitive and boring. Its too fast to end and too slow to play. Not with $1 let alone its actual price of $3.99. Any and all dlc is $4.99. Highly unrecommend this.,negative,0.9431617856025696
Courtney Davis,1/7/2022,"I have the first game of life as well. So that's two games I have bought from yall so far pluse I paid for the season on the first one. Both of your games are laggy and freeze up, albeit the second one less. Just really disappointed in the fact that your games run so poorly.",negative,0.8440643548965454
Cheyenne,1/25/2021,"Horrible. There's a very limited amount of things to do in the game and it has a tendency to frequently freeze and force you to restart the app, which can lose progress you made.",negative,0.9334538578987122
Amanda Taylor,8/16/2020,The games is good but it keeps freezing when playing against computer. I would like fast forward when playing online as I'm bored waiting. The game could be longer. More chances to buy houses and have children and pets,negative,0.4850304126739502
Trinette,7/17/2020,"I love it, It runs smoothly. The only problem that sometimes happens is when you change it to 5x it freezes and you have to reload it to continue. But other then that it's great.",positive,0.867480456829071
Brady McCown,7/22/2020,"Fun game, brings back alot of memories. However the biggest problem I have is it freezes in the middle of the game everytime i play, have to close the app then reboot.",negative,0.4774693250656128

lilladyo2cute,1/3/2021,The game freezes sometimes. I hate that i paid for an app that you have to pay to get all the boards. You should be able to unlock new worlds by completing all the puzzles in a collection. What are the collections for besides items?,negative,0.868155837059021
Rachael Hill,2/18/2021,"Like the game but it keeps freezing up and I have to close it out and then open it again for it to work.

Jessica Nottingham,11/21/2020,"It was okay. For $3.99, I expected there to be a lot more things you can do. I was disappointed that the other boards in the game were another $3.99 each. Also, game kept freezing pretty bad.",neutral,0.3879604935646057
DrunkPauloCosta,9/28/2021,Screw everyone who gave this a good review. Its literally basic and shorter than the other one and instead of making longer versions of the game for 2 players ect its just basically game of life but somehow less fun than number 1.
