Miranda Danforth,1/30/2021,"I wish there were more board options without having to buy an add-on, it's gets a little repetitive. That being said I really enjoy the game, no issues with connecting to other players online. My daughter and I love to play the pass it mode a lot too. I love the new outfits and such that you can earn like little achievements. It's basically a faster version of the old school board game.",positive,0.7763086557388306
Bethany Ng Tang,8/25/2021,"Was really excited to download this game. What you get for $4 is 1 board, the standard outfits and cars, and if you complete 6 ""missions"" you can unlock some really disappointing outfits and 2 cars that look alike. If you want the FULL game, it's $34.99+tax. Outfits start at $.99 and can go up to $3.99, with new boards for $5 a piece. Extremely let down for a game I paid for.",positive,0.5890041589736938
J Barefoot,2/12/2021,It's ok. I didn't mind paying to download. I just hate that you have to pay more to unlock new boards. I pretty much got most of the achievements filled for the free/first/only board you can play. I found myself bored of the same board. I think each board to unlock costs 3.99 or 4.99 (US). Then if you want to unlock other vehicles or outfits etc it too cost 99-3.99. It's ok overall. Going to uninstall though since I got bored of it.,negative,0.6469863653182983
Karla Grubb,1/17/2021,"It's a fun game. It reminds me of the original board game. You can also play with friends in person by passing the phone, or with online players. In single player mode, you can raise the speed of the bots to 5X. Shortcomings are that even though I paid for the game, I still have to pay more money for any bells & whistles. And, the game does not have the stock, or fire & auto insurance. Cute game!",positive,0.9318408966064453
Lisa Piel-Jackson,10/7/2023,"I bought the app, which I rarely do, thinking of how much I used to love playing Life. Then I find out you only get one map and have to pay for any extras. Absolutely no way to earn them, it's pay real money or nothing. Total scam in my opinion. The game seems fun and graphics are cute but I don't need an app that is just a money pit. Returning it!",negative,0.8370701670646667
Nick Smith,10/28/2023,"Not worth the money. $3.99 to download and you only get access to one board. It's $4.99 each for the other boards. Gameplay is ok but repetitive after a couple games and without paying more, you won't get a different experience. Definitely not worth the money.",negative,0.9137387871742249
Katelyn Leslie,8/29/2023,I'm really disappointed in this app. I love the board game growing and was hoping this would be as enjoyable now that it's harder to find people to play the actual board game with. It's not. I feel like I wasted my money buying this because the game play time is too short. You don't have the options you do with the board game. It's really rather boring. I would love a more detailed game board that has more choices and events like insurance etc. And longer like the actual physical game.,negative,0.8843153119087219
Ambrosia Straub,6/27/2023,"I love the difference between the original and this one and really enjoyed playing. I then purchased the fairytale, started a new game, and was so excited to see the cool new gameboard! The 1st player landed on an action space and that's where the disappointment set in. The action cards are the same as in the basic version! I did enjoy seeing the careers are all new, but it's disappointing to see the same old action cards that I'm already bored with that don't have anything to do with fairytales",positive,0.9693782925605774
Jessica Rybka,7/26/2023,"Definitely worth the money, I love playing the pass and play mode with my family everyday. It's really fun and very realistic with taxes. 😅 I one hundred percent recommend buying it. Plus it's only five dollars here in Cad! (5 Star review)",positive,0.9864901304244995
raindrops 33,7/12/2023,"Its a really fun game for a good price - Nostalgic, well made, and lots of ways to play. My only issue is that you get one world, all others are locked. Why not two?",positive,0.8440349698066711
Jarne Vercammen,11/30/2020,It's a great game. The controls are nice and they even added a option for a purple peg indicating non-binary people what is already a step up from the first game of life. But the game of life always has been about the money how much you have art he end and this version kinda defeats the purpose by adding other points. Also for already being a payed game I find it a bit weird to have to pay 10 bucks to get the full experience. For the rest solid game.,positive,0.9032875895500183
Sarah Holt,9/16/2020,"If you like playing the board game, then you will like this version. You have multiple options to play, individual, pass to a friend, even online against other players. You can collect puzzle pieces by accomplishing different tasks as you play and unveil new vehicles, outfits and avatars. I love the online feature and different world. Look forward to more in future.",positive,0.9663401246070862
Tim Richard,7/1/2023,Downloaded with some play credit and very pleased with the game! Just like the board game and it's easy and simple!,positive,0.9872906804084778
pylod two,7/30/2020,"It's the same Game of Life we've come to expect and love. But this time around, there are more variables to consider, more thoughtful decisions needs to be made. Despite those changes, its still fun to play, and still simple to understand its mechanics. Overall, it has better gameplay and deserves a 5-star rating. I also love the fact that it can be played on Samsung Dex, giving me an opportunity to see and enjoy the rich 3D in-game environment on a 40 inch large screen without any lags.",positive,0.8995972871780396
Aliff Suhaimi,11/28/2020,"I bought this game during a sale for MYR 1.00. It is a good game and I really adore it. The game itself looks clean and simple. The customization is limited but sufficient. The gameplay is interesting as it really made me rethink of my life decisions. There are no bugs or crashes yet. Overall, it gets two thumbs up from me.",positive,0.9810112118721008
Nathan Hill,7/16/2020,Playing the single player game works really good and it is fun. I do wish to see cars from basic look then look better while progressing like in the first one. UPDATE: Multi-player works wonder. I did not try marriage in my last review nor tried to grow a family so I did not know the vehicle grows at all until last night. I would love to see more upgrading the vehicle and I want to see a vintage pack like from the first game. I really love those old vehicles in those times. Game is so smooth.,positive,0.9574970602989197
Daniel Ray,10/3/2022,"My family has really been enjoying this game, and we really like the fact that a Facebook account isn't required to play with each other. The only suggestion we have is that it would be nice to have the option for a longer game. Sometimes the game seems very short. Which is fine sometimes, however, a longer game would allow more time to achieve objectives such as buying a house, getting a family with children and pet (it's hard enough sometimes just getting one let alone multiple), etc.",positive,0.9070155620574951
Christine Wagner,6/18/2021,Fun and addictive. All the tradition game with a few more surprises. All the different options for cars and outfits are awesome. Also i love how it doesnt just give the traditional male and female options. There is a 3rd option that is both. For marriage the game gives an option to wear a suit with a veil. Very cool game. I love that I can coop with my family and friends or even play up to four characters on the same device. Very very cool ;),positive,0.9796535968780518
Samin Ali,12/25/2020,I got this game last month during a sale for 50p and I am going to explain my experience from then up to now. First of all purchasing this will only get you 1 board and 1 set of tokens if you want to get more boards and tokens you have to get them separately or in small bundles or buy the season pass which gives you access to all of their current and future boards and tokens. The gameplay is overall pretty fun with cute cinematics. The 1 thing I want is for the boards to be longer.,positive,0.517995297908783
Lil Red DeadHead,7/4/2021,"Grade and always entertaining! With new options putting a twist on the game while still keeping the integrity of classic game of Life. The season pass is also a definite plus! Got it on sale and have not had to buy a single expansion yet, and there's already been four! Highly recommended for anyone of any age for casual entertainment and fun.",positive,0.9740034937858582
Ris AR,2/14/2021,Very addictable... I love the board game and this works for a phone game too. Totally worth the price. Brilliant game. I wish you could send simple prompt messages to hurry up the players - a 4 player game can take a long time. I would also like to send simple emojis to interact with the online players. Lastly the game won't start until all players are ready. Please add a time limit or start the game with less players...,positive,0.954620897769928
Abyss Gaming YT,3/11/2021,"The game is brilliant for family as well as the graphics are good, gameplay is good however I think the game is limited to a free to play who only brought the game. I think a good way is to have a second free environment (as the only free environment is the default) that can be unlocked by unlocking all puzzle pieces from the default map. I say this because it would spice the game up for free to play people as well as make the game more interesting.",positive,0.9610390663146973
NightRay Eclipse,6/13/2021,"This is a great game and ramp up from the original. however it would be nicer to have a longer board. and for children/pets to give a bonus at the end of the game. Also can you please make it cheaper to buy the other maps, i think £4.99 is a bit of a rip off.",positive,0.903721809387207
Henry Hobbs,7/15/2020,"This is a great sequel to the original game of life. I'm really impressed with how polished the game feels on day 1. I didn't encounter any issues while playing. The gameplay itself stays true to the original, while giving the player some more agency so it doesn't feel like a pure game of luck the way the classic game does. I'm a little put off by the day 1 DLC but I've come to expect it from this developer, and its of course not necessary to enjoy the game.",positive,0.9695427417755127
Anthony Young,5/6/2023,"Good game, Nice graphics fun game, bought it on the back on mouse trap giving our small family of 3 loads of sofa fun and multiplayer fun when I'm away working. This however is a paid game with the option of a £30 upgrade....£30 for a mobile game and some extra boards. Had I of seen this I wouldn't have bought as I can't stand company's who are add on heavy and this game is a sumo wrestler when it comes to heavy. Fun to pass the time with family but expect a child asking for the upgrades.",positive,0.8309491872787476

Ari's Adventures,8/22/2020,It's a fun game for a few rounds. I wished I looked how many downloads before buying it though. The online game play is awful and the app just links you up with fake players. You might as well just play offline against the computer smdh. Well thats $4 down the drain pretty much.,negative,0.7756068110466003
Zera Streams,9/6/2021,"I came here from all the mad reviews to tell you the game is fine, they changed it to make it more interesting. The game isn't perfect or proven to make you feel good, it's made me bored while playing 1 game,I favor the first for it is simple. The maps on this one are very creative and it's great they listen to fans. I personally wish pets also could be turn into fairy tail creatures, bought this in 2020 came back 2021 all my stuff is there, it's just an okay game nothing more.",positive,0.6415168046951294

I loved how we could play the game anywhere, anytime and it would save our game. Then, The Game of Life 2 came out, so I pre-registered and got it as soon as it was available.

BossInvader,7/20/2020,"Bought this specifically to be able to play with the kids (Google Family Account) when a physical boardgame isn't feasible, or the wife and I are just looking for some fun childhood games to play together. It is so far better than the original Life App Game, not that it was bad, just outdated and this is a lot more 'snappy', even on our basic free phones from our cell carrier! Great job!",positive,0.8978952765464783
Pamela Williams,3/22/2021,Love this game!!! Lots if fun short animations. Great game play. Wish there was an option to make the game longer such as a spinner wheel with numbers 1-5 and each number is two slots wide. But still love the game.,positive,0.9724172353744507
Shaun Campbell,2/6/2022,"Similar to the original but better animation, the prices at full price are similar to the original aswell, it the same game as is on Steam but at a reduced base price £3.49 Android and £9.99 PC (on limited sale of around £1.49 till 23:59 6th February), the Season Pass however at full price is the same as the PC version at around £24.99 (on limited sale of £17.49 til 23:59 6th February) and the DLC are the same full price of £5.99 each as PC.

Joana Villalobos,1/15/2021,Really fun. I like this game a lot. One of the best features is that you can play with friends using just one phone (pasing it over) or the option to play online with them. Solo play available to. Great game so far.,positive,0.9859805107116699
Ithinkimasofa,3/31/2021,Super fun game. Upgrade to the original. Not sure any of the expansions are worth it as the core board is great. 5 bucks+ for a new board that doesn't bring enough change isn't a good value. But the main game itself is great,positive,0.9262862801551819
