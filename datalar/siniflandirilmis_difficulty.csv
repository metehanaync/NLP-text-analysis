Zoe Luce,9/28/2023,this is a really fun game with lots of potential.. but like.. you get one map and if you want other maps they're $5 a piece after already paying $3.99 for the game.. so as soon as you unlock your collectables on your one and only map it gets boring and you don't want to play anymore. Maps should be unlockable.. imo was super fun to play though reminds me of the old PlayStation game of life back in the day. Use to be my favorite.,positive,0.6803325414657593
Adam Taylor,6/20/2021,"You get 1 map, then have to pay for each map after. Spinner is not actually random. I've tested this, and the spinner will only give you certain numbers, based on your choice at the stops. The computer characters make terrible choices, yet are very ""lucky"" when it comes to landing on the spot they need. You usually win the game, but this game is full of errors. You also spend more time waiting for the other characters to finish, than anything else. This could be a great game,",negative,0.4618437886238098
Julianne,8/7/2020,"The game is fun but short. Especially since the spin function doesn't work well. The amount of times I spin and get a 7, 8, 9, or 10 doesn't seem statistically fair. I feel like I am always going to spin high, thus landing on barely anything good or bad. I wish there was an option for a longer board. At very least, an improvement to randomozation of the spin or use dice instead.",negative,0.8019011616706848
Bethany Ng Tang,8/25/2021,"Was really excited to download this game. What you get for $4 is 1 board, the standard outfits and cars, and if you complete 6 ""missions"" you can unlock some really disappointing outfits and 2 cars that look alike. If you want the FULL game, it's $34.99+tax. Outfits start at $.99 and can go up to $3.99, with new boards for $5 a piece. Extremely let down for a game I paid for.",positive,0.5890041589736938
Kate Hoyt,8/4/2020,"The map is too short. In most of my playthroughs none of the players get a house, let alone buy and sell more than one. Seems like a waste of an idea since it's so rare to land on a house space. There are also many playthroughs without any pets or kids. The map is just too short to experience the content. Also each game has 4 players but there are only 3 different icons to choose. Other than that, it is fun!",negative,0.7936925292015076
LG Hakubi,7/18/2021,"It's okay. I like the updates but the old board game feels more full and dynamic. The spinner needs adjustments because it's way too easy to blast to the end of the game without getting any options. Like I always blow by the family and investment tiles when going down those routes yet somehow I always land on taxes. The game only runs long because you have to wait for everyone, the board isn't large at all. Fast forward should just stay on. DLC costs are incredibly high and not worth it.",neutral,0.4402449131011963
B. P.,1/28/2021,"It's a decent game, but the turns can take too long for online play. Also, there are definitely glitches and bugs that need to be addressed. The game freezes constantly, to the point where you have to close the app in the middle of a game and lose that game. I have a Note20 Ultra, and this game constantly freezes..",negative,0.8826546669006348
Cierra Berrie,9/2/2020,I really enjoy this game! But with the update I lost all of my collectibles... Also seeing a longer game option would be wonderful! I enjoy the shorter board too but having that variety would be a lot of fun. More house spots and more job spots. Even so more risk. Maybe adding in a lose your job space(s) just to make things a little more interesting.,positive,0.9448887705802917
J Barefoot,2/12/2021,It's ok. I didn't mind paying to download. I just hate that you have to pay more to unlock new boards. I pretty much got most of the achievements filled for the free/first/only board you can play. I found myself bored of the same board. I think each board to unlock costs 3.99 or 4.99 (US). Then if you want to unlock other vehicles or outfits etc it too cost 99-3.99. It's ok overall. Going to uninstall though since I got bored of it.,negative,0.6469863653182983
Chyanne DeLong,12/14/2020,Pay to play game 💰💰💰 If you have alot of money then you can really enjoy the app. Cause when I bought it I thought I would have gotten all of it but I was wrong. It includes season passes you can choose to pay. But the game gets boring once you finish the original one. Honestly it feels like the computer is not going getting to pay taxes or and is always getting high numbers and is always going first. It also seems that the computer ends up but gets money 💰 from me but not the taxes.,positive,0.8138478398323059
Rosemary Hernandez,10/24/2020,"If I would have known we only get to play 1 map and have to pay for the others, I would have never purchased this.

I don't recommend if you only want to play 1 map or don't mind paying more for each map.",negative,0.6806058287620544
Karla Grubb,1/17/2021,"It's a fun game. It reminds me of the original board game. You can also play with friends in person by passing the phone, or with online players. In single player mode, you can raise the speed of the bots to 5X. Shortcomings are that even though I paid for the game, I still have to pay more money for any bells & whistles.

Missy Menawonu,7/30/2020,"I liked the first one better, this one is lacking. I have to sit and watch an ad to skip all the CPUs turns when I just spent $3.99 plus tax. Yeah I do not think so. I got my refund and I will not be putting it on my device again. I wish the first game was still being worked on, this is a huge letdown when I was expecting to be blown away. I'd take the crashes and glitches from the first game over this lackluster excuse for a follow up. Talking about fast forwarding through their turns.",negative,0.8528077006340027
Misty Roop,5/1/2022,"The only way to win the game is to choose to stay single and take the investment route. If you get married and go the family route, you lose every time. I also felt that it could last longer. The board seems much shorter, and there is not very much variety between the life cards or job cards. They are very repetitive. Too many things have been changed in not so good ways in my opinion. It's a poor sequel to a great classic game.",negative,0.6742482781410217
Hannah Turner,11/25/2023,The game is awesome now the only thing I don't like is you have to pay $4.99 for other levels but the game is cool either way I love it and it was totally worth paying for. ☺ lol at least I don't have to hear my brother yell every time someone takes his money 😂 😂 😂 I play with computers,positive,0.8710113167762756
Xander Dascomb,10/3/2023,"I feel like the single player is lop side. Most of the time I roll low numbers, and lose the competitive rolls.

Tristan Williams,8/30/2023,"Do yourself a favour and play this game offline. It's a joke playing this on the phone. Rolls are not random. And playing it online, people manipulate it far too easily because the speed required to justify a roll is far too low to actually be helpful. For me in multiple games to land on mostly tax spaces and then be beaten at the end by someone manipulating bucket list rolls every turn is a joke. This game is more frustrating than fun.",negative,0.87734454870224

Scott Barton,7/29/2022,"Ok Game, but too slow and anything extra is paywalled within the game. You get a few small collectibles but if you want to change the board or anything to do with the game its extra. I paid for the game, I'd like everything in it. The cut scenes in the pass and play mode are too slow, the game has 1 clear winning path every time you play, college>invest>house>safe(anything else loses).

Dr Chocolate,7/25/2020,"Honestly not a bad game, I think they made some improvements that is a step in the right path. The only thing that is holding me back from giving 5 stars is that I wish the skip button isn't just 5 times speed and normal speed, 5 times is too fast to see anything, but normal is too slow and boring.

Rob Cowden,10/28/2020,"Much better development, with it going along the old classic game. Like the path scenarios, but just as I was getting into it, it ended. Feel it should have been a longer running path. If you took the board length of the first version with the play format of the new version, you'll be definitely getting there. Update: After a few plays, have a couple of thoughts. Having children only gives you hearts, why no cash bonus at the retirement? The game ends should end on the round not a person.",positive,0.8117420673370361

Monkey Mallow (Monkimallow),1/24/2021,I own the first one on the computer as well and while I really enjoy the unlockables aspect and some of the other mechanics... we no longer get money for action cards collected or children. And of course the two mini-games are no where to be seen in this version of the game. I really enjoy the van mini-game and the 10 meter run one from the first one and think they would fit here too over just doing spins for the highest number.

Caleb Whiting,1/20/2021,"Great game with solid replayability, but caught me off guard with misleading in app purchases. I bought one of the ""new worlds"" to play with my girlfriend only to discover that it only changes the cosmetic appearance without altering the original board in any way.

Kaylin F,1/10/2021,Game is okay but for the price I wouldn't really say worth it. Its very short and I have had it freeze on me 3 or 4 times. When it freezes you miss out on some in game stuff and it just jumps to your turn so you don't really know what happened. It has a bunch of potential but I wouldn't say its worth the money at this point.
