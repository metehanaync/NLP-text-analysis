Zoe Luce,9/28/2023,this is a really fun game with lots of potential.. but like.. you get one map and if you want other maps they're $5 a piece after already paying $3.99 for the game.. so as soon as you unlock your collectables on your one and only map it gets boring and you don't want to play anymore. Maps should be unlockable.. imo was super fun to play though reminds me of the old PlayStation game of life back in the day. Use to be my favorite.
Ashley M,4/29/2021,"I've been looking for a game that I can play that doesn't require coins or dumping money into it to keep going. This is the one. Really fun with length gameplay. Some people don't like the lack of character customization. I don't mind it too much, but that is one area of improvement I see. Can't complain much though - the lack of being bombarded with ads, no coins or timed rewards to play, id gladly pay .99 for a cute character outfit. Awesome job with this one!"
Adam Taylor,6/20/2021,"You get 1 map, then have to pay for each map after. Spinner is not actually random. I've tested this, and the spinner will only give you certain numbers, based on your choice at the stops. The computer characters make terrible choices, yet are very ""lucky"" when it comes to landing on the spot they need. You usually win the game, but this game is full of errors. You also spend more time waiting for the other characters to finish, than anything else. This could be a great game,"
K S,9/5/2020,"Meh...I like some of the options they've added like adopting pets and the gender neutral character, the option not to get married, but there just doesn't seem to be as much variety or as many options as the first one. It just kind of feels extended and dragged out. The only thing you really work at is getting the achievements. Graphics are better of course but not really enough to grab me. Played it a couple of time to see if it got more interesting. Nope. Get #1 if you want to play."
DRG BS,7/17/2020,"It is ok, but here is an issue that I'd like to address for improvement. Online play is a disparaging experience. People tend to quit with no repercussions for it. The game is slow but with details, it is fine if people don't bail. You can tell a player quits when it takes 4 minutes for it to ""auto"" spin. Also, when a player has quit and lands on an action/event tile, the game stops progressing! Stuck until the ""player"" clicks an option. I waited for 20+ min. and the 2 choices were still there!"
Julianne,8/7/2020,"The game is fun but short. Especially since the spin function doesn't work well. The amount of times I spin and get a 7, 8, 9, or 10 doesn't seem statistically fair. I feel like I am always going to spin high, thus landing on barely anything good or bad. I wish there was an option for a longer board. At very least, an improvement to randomozation of the spin or use dice instead."
Miranda Danforth,1/30/2021,"I wish there were more board options without having to buy an add-on, it's gets a little repetitive. That being said I really enjoy the game, no issues with connecting to other players online. My daughter and I love to play the pass it mode a lot too. I love the new outfits and such that you can earn like little achievements. It's basically a faster version of the old school board game."
Saigey Marie,5/31/2021,"The maps could be longer or have an option to switch to 1-5 instead of 1-10 to make it longer and be able to land on more spaces in the game. Could have added power ups or minigames to make it more interesting. The layout is the same in all of them, only the theme is different. I do like the ability to unlock more vehicles, outfits and portraits and the fact there is a nonbinary character. Overall the game is fun but it could be enhanced for better gameplay."
April Sherman,6/9/2021,"Awesome graphics. However I just downloaded the game today and it's already buggy. It started freezing up repeatedly in a game to the point where I had to exit least twice to get the game going, and then finally I wasn't even giving the option to exit anymore and I had to shut the app down and reopen. That caused me to lose the remainder of the game."
Bethany Ng Tang,8/25/2021,"Was really excited to download this game. What you get for $4 is 1 board, the standard outfits and cars, and if you complete 6 ""missions"" you can unlock some really disappointing outfits and 2 cars that look alike. If you want the FULL game, it's $34.99+tax. Outfits start at $.99 and can go up to $3.99, with new boards for $5 a piece. Extremely let down for a game I paid for."
Nicholas R,9/1/2021,"It's a pretty decent mobile game to pass the time. No advertisements which is good since you have to pay money for it. It's a little small in content however. And pretty heavily focused on RNG. But it is modeled after The Game of Life board game which is entirely luck based. This, however, makes it annoying when trying to complete a specific challenge. You can go 4 games in a row and never have a baby just because of unlucky spins. Overall it's pretty good, but could definitely be improved upon"
Mischa Bodenschatz,5/28/2022,"I really enjoy the game. The only problems I have is that I can no longer play on my switch, and on my phone the maps cost money. When I try to play on the switch the map turns purple, and all I can see is the cards. Please fix this glitch. And if it is not to much make a 4 dollar expansion pack of all the maps. Make the separately maps 1 dollar each. That will get you a lot more buys. Other than these two things the game is amazing."
Kate Hoyt,8/4/2020,"The map is too short. In most of my playthroughs none of the players get a house, let alone buy and sell more than one. Seems like a waste of an idea since it's so rare to land on a house space. There are also many playthroughs without any pets or kids. The map is just too short to experience the content. Also each game has 4 players but there are only 3 different icons to choose. Other than that, it is fun!"
LG Hakubi,7/18/2021,"It's okay. I like the updates but the old board game feels more full and dynamic. The spinner needs adjustments because it's way too easy to blast to the end of the game without getting any options. Like I always blow by the family and investment tiles when going down those routes yet somehow I always land on taxes. The game only runs long because you have to wait for everyone, the board isn't large at all. Fast forward should just stay on. DLC costs are incredibly high and not worth it."
Reiko Aburame\Breezy Bree,1/31/2021,"The game is excellent, the graphics are great, everything pretty much is good except for multiplayer when someone is taking too long. Is there a way you can kick them from the game or they get kicked out because it halters the game significantly when you have to wait for a very slow person (looking at you McDino)."
Laura Herman,2/18/2022,"I love it! It's much more fun and enjoyable than the board game, plus there's online multiplayer too, which makes it that much better. However, there is a bug I noticed... Often, in online multiplayer, when someone chooses a job, the game shows the one they didn't pick when it decides their number, it can get confusing. Other than that, it's an amazing game! I purchased the season pass and I don't regret it!"
B. P.,1/28/2021,"It's a decent game, but the turns can take too long for online play. Also, there are definitely glitches and bugs that need to be addressed. The game freezes constantly, to the point where you have to close the app in the middle of a game and lose that game. I have a Note20 Ultra, and this game constantly freezes.."
Constance Fontenot,6/21/2021,I love everything about the game but I have a few problems. When playing by myself I literally just now have lost 10 times in a row from the bottom. Please fix. And I keep trying to land on family to complete one of the collections and with 10 games I haven't landed on family once even with risky route and everything. Please pay attention and try to fix. I will give it 5 stars cause other than that it's perfect!
Cierra Berrie,9/2/2020,I really enjoy this game! But with the update I lost all of my collectibles... Also seeing a longer game option would be wonderful! I enjoy the shorter board too but having that variety would be a lot of fun. More house spots and more job spots. Even so more risk. Maybe adding in a lose your job space(s) just to make things a little more interesting.
J Barefoot,2/12/2021,It's ok. I didn't mind paying to download. I just hate that you have to pay more to unlock new boards. I pretty much got most of the achievements filled for the free/first/only board you can play. I found myself bored of the same board. I think each board to unlock costs 3.99 or 4.99 (US). Then if you want to unlock other vehicles or outfits etc it too cost 99-3.99. It's ok overall. Going to uninstall though since I got bored of it.
Holly Hedges,3/16/2021,"Not worth it. You pay to download and if you want to open any more boards you have to pay for them. They should have made it so you unlock new boards as you accomplish tasks. I could understand paying for extras like avatars, outfits, and vehicles, but the boards shouldn't be a paid item. It was fun for the first couple of times, but it got boring really quickly. Unless you buy the new boards the game quickly loses its luster."
Chyanne DeLong,12/14/2020,Pay to play game 💰💰💰 If you have alot of money then you can really enjoy the app. Cause when I bought it I thought I would have gotten all of it but I was wrong. It includes season passes you can choose to pay. But the game gets boring once you finish the original one. Honestly it feels like the computer is not going getting to pay taxes or and is always getting high numbers and is always going first. It also seems that the computer ends up but gets money 💰 from me but not the taxes.
Rosemary Hernandez,10/24/2020,"If I would have known we only get to play 1 map and have to pay for the others, I would have never purchased this. It's a fun game, but i thought more maps would be become available over time for free or you have to gain puzzle pieces to get it. Something like that. I don't recommend if you only want to play 1 map or don't mind paying more for each map."
Wesley Coon,7/16/2020,I love this game so far! Couple of things though! 1) there needs to be a timer for when an online opponent takes too much time just to speed up the game. 2) I feel like different game modes would be an awesome way to kill time and earn prizes. If that's not possible I understand! Overall love the game and I hope to see some great improvements!!!
Ronnie Hulen,4/1/2023,"Really fun, idle type game. The transactions and bundles are set up beautifully! I didn't want the Frozen Lands bundle, but I really wanted the bear avatar; boom, 99¢ and I got the only thing I wanted, rather than having to fork over $4 for a bunch of things I don't. No ads, runs smoothly, fun challenges to earn free outfits and unlock things if you're a completionist. All around, my favorite game on my phone!"
Fatima Gaskins,7/30/2021,"It's the game of life, but better. The reason for a low rating is that I paid $3.99 for it. Doesn't that mean I should be able to unlock new aspects of the game for free? Why is it $34.99 for all locked content at a ""steal"" of 73% off or $4.99 each? I have no problem paying for a great game, but that should come with a way to unlock all game content for free. If you want to microtransaction people do what other previously paid games (like Plants v. Zombies 2) did and become free."
Karla Grubb,1/17/2021,"It's a fun game. It reminds me of the original board game. You can also play with friends in person by passing the phone, or with online players. In single player mode, you can raise the speed of the bots to 5X. Shortcomings are that even though I paid for the game, I still have to pay more money for any bells & whistles. And, the game does not have the stock, or fire & auto insurance. Cute game!"
Missy Menawonu,7/30/2020,"I liked the first one better, this one is lacking. I have to sit and watch an ad to skip all the CPUs turns when I just spent $3.99 plus tax. Yeah I do not think so. I got my refund and I will not be putting it on my device again. I wish the first game was still being worked on, this is a huge letdown when I was expecting to be blown away. I'd take the crashes and glitches from the first game over this lackluster excuse for a follow up. Talking about fast forwarding through their turns."
Misty Roop,5/1/2022,"The only way to win the game is to choose to stay single and take the investment route. If you get married and go the family route, you lose every time. I also felt that it could last longer. The board seems much shorter, and there is not very much variety between the life cards or job cards. They are very repetitive. Too many things have been changed in not so good ways in my opinion. It's a poor sequel to a great classic game."
Lisa Piel-Jackson,10/7/2023,"I bought the app, which I rarely do, thinking of how much I used to love playing Life. Then I find out you only get one map and have to pay for any extras. Absolutely no way to earn them, it's pay real money or nothing. Total scam in my opinion. The game seems fun and graphics are cute but I don't need an app that is just a money pit. Returning it!"
Hannah Turner,11/25/2023,The game is awesome now the only thing I don't like is you have to pay $4.99 for other levels but the game is cool either way I love it and it was totally worth paying for. ☺ lol at least I don't have to hear my brother yell every time someone takes his money 😂 😂 😂 I play with computers
Nick Smith,10/28/2023,"Not worth the money. $3.99 to download and you only get access to one board. It's $4.99 each for the other boards. Gameplay is ok but repetitive after a couple games and without paying more, you won't get a different experience. Definitely not worth the money."
Maria Wind,11/3/2023,Paid app and not working. Twice now I have had issues with being able to play the game. I contacted support and went through a reset process and it worked for a while but now cannot play again. Just annoying and not worth the money.
vchhjh n v jhrhudhvgiuf,11/7/2023,"It's a very fun game, all the different things you can do deserve in award, Not even Mentioning all the cool maps and environments."
Xander Dascomb,10/3/2023,"I feel like the single player is lop side. Most of the time I roll low numbers, and lose the competitive rolls. Also I'm rarely ever chosen to go first it's always the 2nd bot which causes me to be 3rd, but besides all that it's still entertaining to play."
Angela Calhoon,10/20/2023,This game is extremely boring. I only play it because I spent money buying it. I really regret buying it. The cost to add avatar options is ridiculous. I really would like my money back.
Queen Bee,9/28/2023,"Love this game, i have bought many worlds and play all the time with my friends on the pass and play option. My only wish is to have a different layout of the track in a couple of worlds. Its fun playing but it does get boring after a bit with the same road."
Martin Boyer (Evil),8/28/2023,"Ever since I was young and had my very first computer, I had played the board game, and the computer game. This game is very fun. I like the new boards and cosmetics. I love going for all the collectables one one board before moving on to the next. I've actually played this game for about 4 hours straight one night lol. Anyways, definitely recommend. Bravo Devs, Bravo!"
katelyn kramer,6/27/2023,"While there is a better variety of careers, and peg colors, I always end up rolling high and I don't get things like houses or kids. Not very fun when you don't get to experience everything, I've played several games and they always end the same. Also you get the same tile options in every pack, not a lot of variety."
Katelyn Leslie,8/29/2023,I'm really disappointed in this app. I love the board game growing and was hoping this would be as enjoyable now that it's harder to find people to play the actual board game with. It's not. I feel like I wasted my money buying this because the game play time is too short. You don't have the options you do with the board game. It's really rather boring. I would love a more detailed game board that has more choices and events like insurance etc. And longer like the actual physical game.
Ambrosia Straub,6/27/2023,"I love the difference between the original and this one and really enjoyed playing. I then purchased the fairytale, started a new game, and was so excited to see the cool new gameboard! The 1st player landed on an action space and that's where the disappointment set in. The action cards are the same as in the basic version! I did enjoy seeing the careers are all new, but it's disappointing to see the same old action cards that I'm already bored with that don't have anything to do with fairytales"
Jeffrey Kosse,10/13/2023,Will update Life 2 in a sec after a quick patch in for glitches so I don't need to rebuy content again. I played all the themes for this game.
Tristan Williams,8/30/2023,"Do yourself a favour and play this game offline. It's a joke playing this on the phone. Rolls are not random. And playing it online, people manipulate it far too easily because the speed required to justify a roll is far too low to actually be helpful. For me in multiple games to land on mostly tax spaces and then be beaten at the end by someone manipulating bucket list rolls every turn is a joke. This game is more frustrating than fun."
Jessica Rybka,7/26/2023,"Definitely worth the money, I love playing the pass and play mode with my family everyday. It's really fun and very realistic with taxes. 😅 I one hundred percent recommend buying it. Plus it's only five dollars here in Cad! (5 Star review)"
Zayn Cheadle,10/21/2023,I love the game it has a few tweaks though hoping they can fix those but over all amazing. game especially for the price
B Patel,10/20/2020,"After purchasing the app, I did not know I would only able to play one map. For other maps I have to pay extra - double than the purchased app. Don't purchase the app unless you want to play with one map only. There are plenty of free apps in the market rather than wasting money on it. Edit:Awesome! The team is working hard to resolve the bugs. Everything looks good except minor bugs. When the bot selectes the career, it represents alternative selction done by bot to the users."
Kelly Wood,8/27/2023,"Give me the original any day over this, it's so slow gettin a turn, where as the original it's literally seconds, there's no mini games either unlike the original, and not even anywhere near as long as the original either, not worth 3.99"
Christian Heard,11/27/2023,"Nostalgia. Love the game, never played the board game, so not sure if it's improved much 🤣"
Scott Barton,7/29/2022,"Ok Game, but too slow and anything extra is paywalled within the game. You get a few small collectibles but if you want to change the board or anything to do with the game its extra. I paid for the game, I'd like everything in it. The cut scenes in the pass and play mode are too slow, the game has 1 clear winning path every time you play, college>invest>house>safe(anything else loses). There isn't enough variety to keep the game interesting, it gets boring after just a few play-throughs."
JODIE Moore,9/29/2023,Question. Didn't know how to contact you any other way. Does the big bundle have Everything in it. I'm asking because I bought everything separately before the bundle popped up. I want to purchase all the things for my sissy. So if you could respond I would be greatful. Thank you.
Sammy Rivera,9/21/2023,"It's a very fun game very much like the game of life, you can also play online multiplayer which is amazing, and there's pass and play so you can play it without buying the board game!"
J Peters,9/7/2023,7/10 times it doesn't actually pick up on the fact I've spun. So annoying. Always seems to be when I spin a high number as well.
Hunter Collins,9/11/2023,"It sucks donkey sausage! It's short, it have very few careers, and no options to change the game play style. Very disappointed. Shame on Hasbro"
Heaven Dillehay,11/21/2023,I love this game so much it's so much fun no ads no anything only part on the game and so realistic of the actual game
Dr Chocolate,7/25/2020,"Honestly not a bad game, I think they made some improvements that is a step in the right path. The only thing that is holding me back from giving 5 stars is that I wish the skip button isn't just 5 times speed and normal speed, 5 times is too fast to see anything, but normal is too slow and boring. Other than that, is game is awsome and I would recommend it."
Shandel Langager,2/8/2021,"Great game! Reminiscent of the old classic board game with some fun little twists! Has kept me entertained for countless hours! Looking forward to more worlds and updates! Would be nice to have the option to skip through the animations to keep the game moving on in single player mode or be able to choose a longer or shorter ""trip"" with a bigger game board option and extra vehicles/costumes rewards for completing the larger board. I'm excited to see how this game progresses!"
dstarsfranklin,10/14/2023,Fun and fast. Would like a longer board.
Rob Cowden,10/28/2020,"Much better development, with it going along the old classic game. Like the path scenarios, but just as I was getting into it, it ended. Feel it should have been a longer running path. If you took the board length of the first version with the play format of the new version, you'll be definitely getting there. Update: After a few plays, have a couple of thoughts. Having children only gives you hearts, why no cash bonus at the retirement? The game ends should end on the round not a person."
Jess Boggs,3/13/2021,"Not bad, some action cards are repetitive as mentioned, I kinda hoped the mini games were actual games and not just spinning the wheel. I got this on sale, however I do wish there was a way you could gain access to the new lands versus just having to keep paying. Update: purchased a new world and all this game really has to offer (for the price of $7 CAD) is different cars, avatar picture and outfits for character. The game play itself gets boring and doesn't really change from world to world."
Lucy,7/25/2023,Even though the game cost money there are still micro transactions in order to play different maps since you're only given 1 free map. Fun game but pretty expensive for a game that's supposed to be fun
raindrops 33,7/12/2023,"Its a really fun game for a good price - Nostalgic, well made, and lots of ways to play. My only issue is that you get one world, all others are locked. Why not two?"
Kaboa Yang,6/29/2023,"Super fun game. Down fall you gotta buy each world but it's not too bad. It's fun seeing what the other worlds have for clothes, vehicles, jobs etc."
Brittany Lafferty,7/16/2023,The game was fun up until the recent update I guess...now It tells me my device no longer supports the app. How do you change it from a system you already had to pay to play it to begin with ??
Gabriela Leon,8/14/2023,"I think it is really good and fun but some details have been left out of the original game, like the family points dont count, and it feels shorter"
Kailey Kirkwood,6/12/2023,Fun game just wish the other boards were cheaper than 4.99 I feel like they should be more like 1.99 than more people would probably buy them other than that alot of fun I love how they have an online option
Jarne Vercammen,11/30/2020,It's a great game. The controls are nice and they even added a option for a purple peg indicating non-binary people what is already a step up from the first game of life. But the game of life always has been about the money how much you have art he end and this version kinda defeats the purpose by adding other points. Also for already being a payed game I find it a bit weird to have to pay 10 bucks to get the full experience. For the rest solid game.
Ziec Gower,11/17/2023,Good up until it wouldn't let me fix my name and changed my name to player.
Branson Pappageorge,11/17/2023,"Could be a little longer but it's fun, especially with friends."
Emily Buerger,3/30/2022,"I like the game, I like the options, just wish there were more options. Like more kids and houses, being able to choose a longer board vs the shorter boards. I like the collectibles, just wish there were more themes and collectibles to unlock. also wish that some of the options were more spaced out like being able to have kids and houses, not having to pick between one or the other. Would also be cool to see spouses get jobs. Would love to see some more of these options added!"
Monkey Mallow (Monkimallow),1/24/2021,I own the first one on the computer as well and while I really enjoy the unlockables aspect and some of the other mechanics... we no longer get money for action cards collected or children. And of course the two mini-games are no where to be seen in this version of the game. I really enjoy the van mini-game and the 10 meter run one from the first one and think they would fit here too over just doing spins for the highest number. (It gets a bit boring after a while.)
Vanessa Fundora,7/26/2020,In the Game of Life the first one the game play has many more options more styles and mini games this just isn't hitting the spot for me like the 1st one. Kinda regretting spending $4 on this game I hope they do some improvements. It says it has more choices than the 1st an it really doesn't I mean family wise the 1st one has children scattered around the board. I feel like the Board is shorter than the original one as well...I would like to know when I will get my refund back. Thank you
Sarah Holt,9/16/2020,"If you like playing the board game, then you will like this version. You have multiple options to play, individual, pass to a friend, even online against other players. You can collect puzzle pieces by accomplishing different tasks as you play and unveil new vehicles, outfits and avatars. I love the online feature and different world. Look forward to more in future."
Caleb Whiting,1/20/2021,"Great game with solid replayability, but caught me off guard with misleading in app purchases. I bought one of the ""new worlds"" to play with my girlfriend only to discover that it only changes the cosmetic appearance without altering the original board in any way. Advertised as ""new worlds, visuals and cosmetics"", you would expect an entire new board rather than a skin. I would typically request a refund, however, the game is still enjoyable and I wish the developers all the best."
Leah Gibbons,5/17/2023,"This game is very fun. I wish we could change the names of the players in Pass and Play, that we could oust players who are taking a really long time to make moves in Online Multiplayer, and that we could view the different houses/jobs, etc. that we've gotten throughout the game. Also, the family choices are glitchy; I've chosen dog and gotten a cat, I've chosen a girl baby and gotten a boy. It's not cool that you have to pay $4.99 each to unlock other boards when the game already costs $."
Kaylin F,1/10/2021,Game is okay but for the price I wouldn't really say worth it. Its very short and I have had it freeze on me 3 or 4 times. When it freezes you miss out on some in game stuff and it just jumps to your turn so you don't really know what happened. It has a bunch of potential but I wouldn't say its worth the money at this point. Make the board longer or at least give the option for a longer board and work out the little kinks and it would definitely be a great game
Anna D. (Sebbanna J.),6/27/2023,I purchased the Haunted Hills Map a few weeks back and now it's telling me I need to purchase it again. A little bit irritated with that and don't want to be purchasing it over and over again if that's the case. And yes I have Uninstalled and reinstalled the game. Nothing changed by doing that.
Jasmine Quintanilla,10/14/2020,"Fun, classic Life experience. I do like the fairy tale add on as well. Online can be frustrating when opponents aren't taking turns. There isn't a timeout or anything so you just wait forever. I gave it 3 stars because of this, and because I paid for the World bundle months ago and am still waiting. I'm wondering when another world (or world's) will be out."
MacKenzie Tumak,5/5/2023,"Board is short, repetitive, and overall it's boring. I loved the computer disc version of this game once upon a time, but this seems so short and low effort. There are a ton of extra things you have to pay for, and they want $60 for the whole bundle. This wasn't even worth the $6, definitely wouldn't waste any more money."
Masquerade PW,7/29/2021,"Fun but flawed. While the game is fun, it's hard to tell whether you're playing against AI or players. Frequently, you'll end up facing opponents who only get perfect rolls. This makes it frustrating to play because the RNG begins feeling incredibly lopsided. It's also tough to play with friends because you can't invite friends to matchmade sessions - if you want to play with your friends, you'll have to accept that your only other opponents will be the AI. Ultimately, I recommend the game"
Elizabeth Pringle,8/18/2020,"This version is so much better than the original! Theres much more freedom in how you play, so you're not really 'required' to get married and have children to win. It's more about the experiences you gather, so I won by staying single, buying my own apartment and adopting a cat and dog while studying for a masters degree! It feels more satisfying, so I started playing making my own choices, instead of tactically deciding how I can get more stuff!"
Mr. Cooper,2/9/2022,Problems: 1. 5x game speed resets every time a human player has a turn. 1x speed is far too slow even for a human player. 2. 5x game mode causes the game to regularly freeze. 3. There is no variation between maps other than the art. 4. 30 children requires too many replays of map to secure the collectible. The number required should be akin to the house requirement. 5. The intro should be skipable. 6. The computer AI too frequently makes poor decisions. 7. The spinner is RNG controlled.
Bekka Babcock,7/20/2020,Price was decent. I like the puzzle pieces but I see the same cards and jobs over and over so that tells me there isn't a lot of different choices or options with action cards or jobs. I like you can speed up other players turns when playing solo and I like the fairytale land but the price for that was ridiculous. Hopefully they make this game a lot more different than the 1st.
Tim Richard,7/1/2023,Downloaded with some play credit and very pleased with the game! Just like the board game and it's easy and simple!
Anna Johnson,8/23/2020,"For the first day I expected some glitchs when playing solo sometimes the AI glitches and freezes and multiplayer also happens when the screen freezes and won't let you choose options but this game is fun and obviously I don't expect it to be perfect when it's so new, please just take my experience into your concerns. edit: all of my concerns have been adressed and I no longer have those problems"
May Luurt,7/1/2023,"I love this game, there may not be many options and types of jobs and choices but it can still be a blast. Nothing else to say..."
Erik Hunt (whiskyjacked),6/23/2021,"Kinda fun, but you have to buy more maps...after buying the game!! What a joke! I can understand having to unlock more maps/boards but not having to BUY them all. And the game is pretty fun, but $35 on sale is what it costs on top of the game purchase to unlock the other boards. Shameful. Update!: It also loves to randomly freeze up completely!"
Taylor Baldwin,8/5/2020,"Great so far! The graphics are awesome. The little pegs of people and animals are adorable and still board game feeling! The only thing from 5 stars is... Sometimes it loads and freezes, so I've had to force close the app several times but hey! Its still a work in progress and so far its just like life!"
Ryan Garner,10/1/2020,"Fun game to kill time, you can play solo vs Ai, online vs other people, or with a friend or three locally by just passing the phone or whatever back and forth. There are unlockable items from completing milestones that you can use to customize your little guy. Only knock I have on the game is that you cannot play on new maps without buying them, would be cool to have a way to unlock those for free somehow"
Sierra,11/28/2020,"Got this during a sale and definitely am having fun with it! Games have a decent amount of time, you can play with AIs instead of having to play online with other people, and it seems well balanced so far. Will update if that changes! Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that in game purchases are extremely expensive. I saw a couple that are more than the game at full price! Definitely tone that down some. Maybe less for the different versions & have another pay option for different costumes?"
Zoe Clarke,10/19/2022,"The family and I absolutely love this game, it's great for all ages. Loads of fun. But....I am having issues with purchasing additional boards. I already own the age of giants board, and when I go to purchase anything, it's unable to connect to the store, which is extremely disappointing as I would love to get the VIP pass. Any information as to why I am unable to make additional purchases would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for bringing a great old game to life. I agree longer games options."
Vero Rodriguez,7/21/2020,Fun! It's very fun to play and it is so awesome. You put a lot of effort into this and I love it. Though there is a problem. I'm multiplayer some people never ready up. Can you make it so they have atleast 1:30 to ready up before getting kicked or something? I also found a bug there. When you try to press the ready button sometimes it wont work. There are some problems but other than that I would recommend buying this game.
Jesse,4/1/2021,"The game itself is super awesome and addictive, although the Season Pass price is absolutely insane! €20 for cosmetics, nuh, uh! The MAX I would pay is probably €10. I will give this game 5 stars if they lower the price. | Edit: After playing the game some more I noticed that they didn't include all of the fun mini games from the previous version, kinda dissapointing... | Edit 2: Currently there is a special for the Season Pass and they're advertising it at 50% off when it's the SAME PRICE!"
Azure “TheStainsOfTime” Wolf,8/28/2023,All I gotta say for some dlc maps may be 50%off but come on life the game of life I could just play the actual boardgmar where I get consualy messed up you got the all the taxes. In real life come on.
C J,5/31/2022,"Online feature doesn't work. It says there's a connection issue but my Internet is working fine. Apparently there's not many players who use it anyway, however that might be too do with the connection issues. The game is also very quick, and there is not a big variety of cards. The same cards come up each game so I think this will get boring quite quickly, particularly going against a computer all the time. It's a game that has promise, but needs work."
Shana King,3/14/2022,Fun but the game keeps freezing and I have to hit save and quit to get it to unfreeze. Once it froze right at the end though when it was determining the winner and I had to force course and that game progress was lost. Now I'm having it so that it will randomly shut down completely and close the game on me. I was hoping to not have any issues but I'm not willing to buy the expansions as is right now.
Van Kirwin,1/17/2021,"Don't suppose they'll give a refund, so don't bother with this one. You get to make a few choices: (college/career), (get married/stay single), (safe path/risky path). But sadly the way you receive attributes is just by random chance, especially after you retire. You also have to hope you land on an orange spot to buy a home, and the lucky numbers add nothing to the game. Same experience every time... Waste of money, especially for the other maps which are $4.99 each."
AKHIL GOYAL,4/17/2023,"This game is fun when you play for the first time but as you play again and again it gets really boring. It is a 4 player board game but you have to wait for a looooooong time before your turn and it really sucks. This game is just so easy I can say even a 5 yr old child can win every single time if he knows what to do. There are just too less variables in this game, it makes winning too easy. Its like you just have to choose same path again and again. I just feel like waste of money."
Ryan Garvin,12/17/2021,"It's definitely not the best version of life but it's the best you can get on your phone. They really need to add an option to limit the rolls from 1-5, 1-6 or something less than 10. The board is so short and the games go so fast. There's never a chance to do anything. Being able to buy a house is so so rare because you are constantly skipping over all the opportunities. Same goes for most other things, you're lucky if you get to do anything interesting in the game."
Sumon Khan,7/28/2020,"This game is good, but whenever someone is not taking their turn it keeps loading, there should be a time limit for taking turn or choosing the choices! Edit: Ty, now there is timer! And one more thing, it will be great if there is a league system based on points or what you think better! It will attract people more to play! Or this game will be boring after playing week!"
Anthony D,9/28/2020,Game can be fun. Too short of a board as far as game play. It's upsetting to pay for it only to open it up and find there is another board completely hidden behind a pay wall that's more expensive than the game itself..?..cosmetics are a little pricey for what you get too in my opinion. Otherwise than that I've enjoyed what I've played
Kyrsten Langley,11/29/2020,"Good game and a excellent time killer. My only complaint is the game needs to be longer between each achievement. Aka Collage, Marriage, Retirement ect. It would make the game easier to get into and not feel like such a rush. I gave 3 because the game feels incomplete, more like a demo."
PhsycoRobloxian,2/26/2021,"YESSS this game is soo good. It basically really really fun and even when you don't win, you get some good collectibles along the way to customise yourself. I am like, about 40 collectibles now. I just need 8 more to maximize it and maybe I can buy the other maps to get some pretty new collectibles for my character design. Thank you so much and I hope you guys update regularly!! 💖🎉"
Pork Chopper,6/8/2021,It's the Game of Life. If you've played the board game you know roughly what to expect. It's got one really big problem though. The maps are comically short. I get it. Some mobile gamers want quick experiences. But there should be an option. A longer map and a shorter map. I've played a few games but I honestly don't think I'll be going back because it's too short to be enjoyable.
Brittany Michael,7/15/2020,Alright. Could be improved by fixing the big where you must press FF5x every time anything changes in the change (very annoying). Also in online multiplayer there should be a timeout when a player stops playing and the computer takes over for them. Otherwise you get trapped in limbo.
The Tony,7/18/2023,Game is grate looks awesome and you dont wait longer that a minute for a online match. And game is also cheap.
tazdevil335,1/2/2021,The game is a classic and if that's what you are looking for you may enjoy the game for 5 minutes. The game title makes the game sound like they added a ton of new features and better gameplay. However its the same exact game as the first just for more money. They even make you pay for the game and then try charging you in game purchases to get the addition maps for more money. The paid version is fun for about 5 minutes before It gets repetitive. When asking for a refund after it was denied.
Victoria Smith,4/28/2021,"I'm a huge fan of the original board game and this feels like a step back. I love the new options like having a pet rather than a child but the changes in gameplay are disappointing. I played 3 games and never once got a house, that's disappointing. The life tiles are really low stakes now. Everyone is having guitar lessons or upgrading their computers rather than vacations or sending kids to summer camp. Also the game is way shorter now and the outfits feel like a money grab."
pylod two,7/30/2020,"It's the same Game of Life we've come to expect and love. But this time around, there are more variables to consider, more thoughtful decisions needs to be made. Despite those changes, its still fun to play, and still simple to understand its mechanics. Overall, it has better gameplay and deserves a 5-star rating. I also love the fact that it can be played on Samsung Dex, giving me an opportunity to see and enjoy the rich 3D in-game environment on a 40 inch large screen without any lags."
Angel Smith,4/3/2022,"This game could be more fun if like someone said, there were longer boards. It does feel too short at times. But my main hangup is that this game freezes way too much. And it's not even my phone. I know ppl on other phones that it happens to. Shame but I really feel this should be free. Or at least no more than a few dollars for the whole thing (all expansion packs included)."
Lee B,8/3/2020,"I have always love the game of life, and I love the updated and goal oriented gameplay of this one. I love the male, female, nonbinary choice for pieces. The reason I am doing 4 stars is becsuse of Fairytale Kingdom. My expectations were it would be a full fantasy map with everything altered to be fantasy/medieval-- considered the price. I was disappointed to find it was essentially just a fairytale skin. The house and jobs changed but everything else stayed modern. Poor purchasing choice."
K C,9/17/2023,"I absolutely love this game! Cool game play, great graphics, and lots of different options to choose from for your character etc. No ads while I played, which was also fantastic!!! Great job on this one 👏 👍"
Emily Groberski,8/9/2021,"One of my favorite Game of Life adoptions. The different boards are super neat and I love the different outfits. Totally worth it to buy the season pass. I do agree that it feels odd to charge for the base game and then make people pay for the different unlocks, but it keeps me entertained as well as something to do to pass the time with the kids while we're waiting in line or on long car rides."
Anna Hapiuk,7/2/2021,"Disappointed in this game. I was hoping it would be more like the modernised version where you can come back to options like getting married and having kids but you can't- once you make the choice, that's it for your ""life"", you can't come back to it later. Cost of things in the game like surfing lessons are ridiculous, not to mention the cost of the game itself. Paid $6 for it and its only the basic version. I'd have to pay another $60 odd for the full version. Uninstall after 1 play."
Steven Carter,9/17/2021,"It's Different from the Board game but does evoke some of the old charm.There could be more spaces to travel,and they could show the Details of the Upcoming Spaces,but, I really do enjoy the way it plays. It's silky smooth,nice cute cartoon ish quality that I imagine kids would like.The wheel can be a bit easy to manipulate,though just when you think you've mastered the high number spin,it reverts To lower numbers.It let's you play online,or head to head,or against the Computer.I recommend it!!"
Aliff Suhaimi,11/28/2020,"I bought this game during a sale for MYR 1.00. It is a good game and I really adore it. The game itself looks clean and simple. The customization is limited but sufficient. The gameplay is interesting as it really made me rethink of my life decisions. There are no bugs or crashes yet. Overall, it gets two thumbs up from me."
Ash K (Shortgrace),1/9/2022,Great overall game. Pretty similar to the board game but for the price I expected more. For $4 you only get 3 outfits and the standard board game. For another $35 you can unlock the rest. So ur paying $40 for customizations that is jus simply that. Customizations.... the boards aren't even that different. A bit of a let down for a classic game fanatic
Hillary D.,1/2/2021,Wonderful game and beautifully illustrated. Highly recommend if you like the classic board game. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it won't let me use the 'online multi-player' because it says I don't have an internet connection when I do (wifi). I don't have an unlimited data plan so that's not an option for me... And I feel like for the price of the game it should let me connect via wifi.
Acliptic,7/20/2020,"So Having just played my first game prior to writing this review it was amazing the gameplay is incredible There was just one small problem and this is why I'm leaving 4 starts After accidently pressing the settings button I obviously pressed ""Resume"" but the banner that drops done when pressing settings got stuck halfway up the screen. So this meant I couldn't read the information that drops down at the end. So I thought Id write a review to let the Devs know (picture is available on request)"
Bill Carlson,10/14/2022,The game is more generic than I expected. A little more interaction with the animations would be nice. As well as the choice to play two or three friends. Also navigating through the outfits and puzzle pieces are a little bit confusing.
Quality Girl,4/26/2021,"I would rate this a five star if they have more of a variety of characters, etc. To choose from. Otherwise this game is awesome if you really love The Game of Life. As well when I play multiplayer I can do something else and can come back one minute later and the game still plays. No buffering, no nothing. I love this."
Kelly Metzler,12/28/2020,"Updated: my issues have pet much been fixed completely! Thanks! My only wish is that we could chat in game with our friends. Since I downloaded the frozen land, it's really glitchy and freezes up a lot. It'll go to 5 once the issues are fixed. Could also be the solar storm we are getting tonight, but unsure. Wanted techs to see."
Nathan Hill,7/16/2020,Playing the single player game works really good and it is fun. I do wish to see cars from basic look then look better while progressing like in the first one. UPDATE: Multi-player works wonder. I did not try marriage in my last review nor tried to grow a family so I did not know the vehicle grows at all until last night. I would love to see more upgrading the vehicle and I want to see a vintage pack like from the first game. I really love those old vehicles in those times. Game is so smooth.
Spencer Vincent,9/11/2023,"So happy they have a ""local multiplayer"" option to hand the phone to your partner. We love it."
newleif 97,8/31/2020,"£30 season pass for a one time purchase is ridiculous. I already paid £4.99 for a game with no free trial or demo just misleading adverts instead. Its far too short. No overall reward at all so its pointless comtinuing playing when you are already loosing. You should be able to win coins and gems to spend in a shop for more outfits etc. And have a leaderboard. Needs a chat option its so boring otherwise, people take too long. Apart from that its pointless playing with no overall reward or board"
k b,10/10/2020,"It's a fun game for killing time or spending time with your kids, but they have been promising new worlds since it came out. I've bought the season pass, I'm looking for more boards to keep my interest. Haven't opened the app in over a month because it is lacking anything new, and certainly lacking what I've paid for."
David Askew,8/9/2020,"It's a fun game and I enjoy playing it. I was expecting more options and opportunities within the game to build up points (making it more real life). I actually think each game is too quick - its a shame there is not different options for game lengths. Also, not many people seem to use the online game facility - I often just get pitted against 2/3 automated players."
Angelique Gonzalez,7/11/2023,Unable to play online. Says no internet connection with mobile data and wifi connection. Waste of money.
Data Lore,7/19/2020,"The game is cute and interesting, but the progression is very short and linear. There isn't a lot of variety between each game and not picking college and the investing route just doesn't give you any true lasting rewards. The little extra points you collect aren't worth much and don't reward you for not taking the money routes. Overall the replayability of these very short matches is basically nonexistent. Fun for about an hour and then that's about it. Also it gets old to have repeat the 5x"
Jon S,2/14/2021,"It's well done but I wish that I could unlock new outfits by just playing and unlocking them, rather than have to pay microtransactions. I'd get it if the game was free but I paid for this. Given, its just aesthetics, but its just annoying. 90 percent of the enjoyment I get out of games is unlocking things and its hard to come by with phone games. But it's a fun game, I'd reccomend it. I just wish developers took a step back from microtransactions if I have to pay for the game outright."
Benjamin Taylor,2/21/2022,"At it's current state, it's not very great. The games are way way too short and fast paced. There were often games where I would never get a house or kids. I would really appreciate a feature to have longer more in depth games. This is a sequel after all and I think a longer game/ longer board would be an incredible way to build upon the first game. Like I hated rolling an 8-10 because rolling those high numbers means skipping entire sections of the game."
As St,8/11/2020,"I've been playing the game of life before the ages of technology. I love the new choices, like stay single or married, brilliant. My suggestions to you is this, in the original game we had twins, children gave retirement money. Each player gave a gift for one child. In the app game we had the option to have triplets/quads, please bring this back. In addition to the careers, I find very basic, it doesn't match the ""2"" I guess I was expecting more of a hierarchy of careers. Thk u"
Breyden Coates,4/1/2021,Occasionally the game just freezes and you have to close the app to fix this. It's happened 5 times on the final point screen and I didn't get to see the points or who won. I've only had game a day. If it weren't for the freezes this would be a great app.
Daniel Ray,10/3/2022,"My family has really been enjoying this game, and we really like the fact that a Facebook account isn't required to play with each other. The only suggestion we have is that it would be nice to have the option for a longer game. Sometimes the game seems very short. Which is fine sometimes, however, a longer game would allow more time to achieve objectives such as buying a house, getting a family with children and pet (it's hard enough sometimes just getting one let alone multiple), etc."
Daskut,7/20/2020,"Fun game overall, haven't seen any bugs yet and online works fine. ⚠️Only problem: 130€ (or 35€ at 73% off) for the full content after I already paid for the game!?!? Sorry but that's not gonna happen. I'm fine with having some microtransactions to get customizations and what not (like you have) but not with having to pay for 10 out of 11 maps (that will be released in the future). Easily worth 5 stars but the price makes it 3 until you change this."
Sakhina De-Niro,2/10/2023,"I had some issues randomly start to happen, this is an isolated issue and it was fixed so quickly! The staff have been absolutely fantastic and kept me upto date, whilst fixing my problems. The game itself is fantastic and fun!! Yes there is in app purchases but it is well worth the money :D"
J Ahn,9/17/2020,Fun game but freezes too much. Well not so much as completely frozen but it will not progress at times. Animation and sound still works but nothing happens until I restart the App. Edit: I cleared my cache and no longer had this issue. Not sure if its the app or my phone but will update if I encounter freezes again.
John Dean,8/13/2020,"I would give this game 5 stars for playability but for a 4 dollar game, the amount of paid add-ons is insane. $30 for a season pass?!? Apex Legends and games alike don't charge nearly that much and add incentives to the pass. Player skins should be unlockable by player currency that could be implemented in the game but they want to charge $1 for a peg with clothes on it. I much prefer the original game of life. The only redeeming factor is that it is playable online with friends."
Sumitra Limbu,12/15/2020,"Very disappointed with the purchase. I was expecting more and thought there would be some perks or something new but I have to purchase and spend another $4/$5 for something new. That doesn't make sense. As fun as this is, the novelty runs off once you reach the end and its the same thing over again so if I paid $4 just for the stimulation and ads-free, it was not worth it."
Veronica Petkau,11/25/2020,"Might increase rating later if they increase game play time. Honestly, as soon as you get into it - it ends! Other than that, it's a great version of the game. Love all the options like the 'child or pet' option is nice. When an AI player chose a pet before marriage they got a cat. Cat rides shotgun most of the game then player chose to have a '2nd Chance' wedding ... and their new spouse HAD TO SIT IN THE BACK SEAT xD hahahaha that's a little brutal but honest I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️"
rzrocket,1/30/2023,"Ok so let me get this straight. So before I ""bought"" this game I was looking at what the game had to offer. Build a house, explore/discover new worlds. So I downloaded the game with the understanding that I can unlock new game boards and have my own custom player home to decorate as I like. But no. I shelled out money for the game only to find you have to pay more for the new worlds. Same boring game it has been for literal decades."
Erin Yell,4/6/2022,"It's fun enough, I suppose. I really wish that there were different color options for our skin aside from pink, blue, and purple. I don't like that they're indicative of gender. I like the light blue a lot, but it's sad I can't wear a dress on my wedding day. The board is the exact same no matter what expansion you choose, so it can feel a bit boring at times. Rolling high numbers is the worst because the board is so short. I wish that there were randomized maps, so its new(ish) every game."
Cruors,8/19/2020,"Not a bad game but I feel the season pass is not worth it, they need to actually change the card/job/properties to the theme too so really brings the quality up and the excitement/discovery to the board way up instead of it just being a board skin and a song mostly which only makes you feel passive about it and doesn't change the game all that much for it to be worth it, my friends were disappointed. Adding new cards to the deck would also be nice too for such a steep price tag for skins."
A MEL,11/28/2020,"So many users mentioned a constant crash while playing the game. I investigated the claim. The app tries, without explicit consent from the user, to RECORD audio from the phone. Having Android 10, mic permissions have to be given explicitly and the app didn't ask for them, so it crashed. If you're facing a crash issue, go the app setting (Android App Setting) and give it mic permission, if you are okay being recorded by a game app. Personally, I'm uninstalling and getting refund. Very Shady."
Nite Crawla,7/15/2020,"The game needs options. 1.) If a choose to speed up the Computer players to 5X speed I think I would want to speed up the other 2 computer players as well. It's assinie to keep having to click 5X speed for each computer players turn. I want to be play my turn not have to wait for all the animations for everything else. 2.) You want to grab my attention to tell me to soon for ""highest soon prize"" or that players are waiting for me to do something? how about a vibration notification?"
Edmin Rossy,9/1/2020,THE GAME OF LIFE 2 is by far the best board game on the market. The reason I give the game a 4 star is because It feels like it's watered down and extremely short. I would really love to see a longer board. I'm excited for the new road maps. As you can tell the biggest issue I have is the game feels extreamly short. Also the next update can you guys add more customization. Can we please have a LEADERBOARD 🙏. Sorry I keep editing but can you add emotions so we can have some type of communication
Shanice Benjamin,9/21/2020,Overall the game is fun. My only hangup (and I'm not sure if others are experiencing this as well) is the lagging at the beginning and end of the game. When choosing the game order and when tallying up the money and what not. It's actually pretty annoying.
Jack Peters,4/20/2023,"The game is pretty fun however the description and images imply that other worlds are included. Instead you need to pay extra, a lot extra, in order to be able to play on these worlds. Of course the developer just provides this typical response about how it's normal to pay more for things... False advertising might be normal but it's against the law."
Chris Faulk,3/23/2023,I will agree with other reviews that the game mechanics are not at all random or fair. CPU very often gets high number spin or lands on the perfect spot or gets max value for house sale OR high salary OR lands on their own lucky number multiple times in a row. I just played and spun 3 or under 7 times in a row. I actually used to win games but have been 4th place (I do know how to place this game) the last several times I've played. I haven't also landed on a family space in the last 10 rounds.
Melissa Torres,8/9/2020,"My 7-year old and I love playing the game! The graphics are great and she loves seeing what happens when she makes different life choices. With that said: 1. We would like to see at least 4 different player tokens so there are not 4 wheels, skateboards or birds when looking at the aerial view of the game board. Once a token is selected, it can't be used by another player. 2. Is there a way to personalize the name for Player 2, 3 and 4 when there are 4 humans playing? We tried everything in the edit mode including tapping the name plate and nothing works to change the name. The names do change when they are computer players. If there is a way to change to names when in ""human"" mode, it is not intuitive. 3. As other players mentioned we do wish there was an option for a longer board. I like the short version that exists right now but when we have time for a longer game, another few routes would be great, with more house spaces, salary spaces and other perks. Does not seem to be very many house spaces, we've played many games when neither of us had more than one degree and both had zero houses. We do love the 2nd chance spots!! 4. The ""risk"" road seems boring since it's all Wheels of Fate with a few Taxes spots sandwiched in. We hate landing on a Wheel of Fate because we ALWAYS get Taxes. Also where is the reward for taking the risk? Would be nice to have a couple of very large financial gains on that street, like a $500k spot and a House Inheritance or something. How about a free scholarship for another degree? 5. Does it matter which spouse you choose if you go down the Marriage road? Are there advantages over one or the other? This isn't explained, unless there are no special advantages of one over another (there should be if there are not). I guess same thought on kids, are there advantages to having kids? If yes, what are they? 6. I would like to be able to pay back debt when I get paid my salary, that would be a nice ""pause"" option when cruising over a paycheck collection space. 7. It's nice having two career choices after completing an education purchase but we always take the higher paying job, why would we choose the other one? THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME GAME!!! Melissa and Sophia"
Mike Rumans (Popnfresh-Trex Popn),12/21/2020,"I had originally done a 5 star just because the game is a childhood favorite. I've played many many rounds on the starter board. Then was informed of a 1 time only sale for 50% off season pass where it suddenly went to 34.99 as retail but could be bought for 17.99 So I bought it just cuz I was enjoying it. A few hours later, suddenly it says to get the season pass for 73% off. Kind of shady marketing. Still enjoy the game and not as excited but still am none the less to see other boards."
Alex Wawroski,2/15/2022,"A whole lot of fun, and surprisingly charming art and animation! I don't recommend the 5x speed up option because it causes freezes, but you can just minimize the number of opponents to speed things up instead."
Jessica Weaver-Kenney,2/24/2021,"It's fun and the new additions are interesting but it feels like I miss out on a lot of life events. I played 2 games and both times I never got to have kids or pets. I also don't like how buying a house isn't guaranteed either. Are my spouse and I just living in our car?? I just remember in the first mobile Life game and in the boardgame, I got to experience more. I think this one focuses too much on education and careers, which is ok, but there are so many other aspects of life."
Tejpreet Mundi,1/11/2021,"Here are few suggestions to improve this game. 1: In game chat, emotes/taunts and voice chat with ability to mute players individually. Without them, the game feels boring without the social aspect. 2: Game feels too short sometimes. Maybe make another mode with more tiles, or more paths to choose from? 3: Jobs are almost always repetitive. I expected larger pool of jobs to choose from. And by that i don't just mean different names for them. 4: Ability to add friends. Specially fellow players."
Saltiest Meatball,1/25/2021,"Deapite having a top of the line phone and 5G/1GB Wifi, the game still refuses to play well. Constantly freezes either during the game or during the score tallying, forcing you to void the whole game. Happens basically every other game. I would vote 0 stars if I could. Poor optimization."
Vicki Louise,12/30/2022,"I love the game so much! However, I have been trying to install the ultimate life collection all day. I have emailed multiple times and I have still not been able to get this to work. I have purchased on other games today to see if this was not an in game issue however I have had no other issues with any other purchases. I am very disappointed as I love the gameplay so much but I am going to miss out on the sale opportunity due to the issue."
Jennah Wittenbarger,7/16/2020,"The game is fine. Nothing spectacular. The original version is still the best. At least in the original you get rewards for ""expanding your family"" - Also, when given the option for a ""better"" job, it's not necessarily better, esp with the new ""taxes"" addition. The plus is being able to stay single and have pets instead of kids, but, there's no real incentive. It still ""rewards"" you for getting married in the way of TAKING money from the other players. Not worth purchasing when original is free."
Ashley Nicole,9/17/2020,"Within 10 minutes of opening the app it turns my whole phone off. At first i thought it was a coincidence but nope, it still shuts my phone completely off anytime i try to play the game. I havent even gotten to play a whole round, yet i paid money for the game. It doesnt give any warning or reason why my phone restarts but ive never had this happen to me before. I guess I'll be deleting the app since its only use seems to be taking up space, as of now."
Terri Charlton,8/23/2020,"Game constantly freezes! I have missed many of the final scores due to the game freezing. When it freezes during gameplay, I can save and quit and return but the final score is pretty important and it won't allow me to save and return at that point."
MTFBWM,7/25/2021,"Very fun game, just wish the aesthetics of the game would change according to the set used (for example: move with swimming, jet-ski or surfing effects when using the seaside theme instead of just driving along on the same track). Otherwise a great game."
Jessica Sunderland,9/1/2020,"Lost all progress when I had to reinstall the game. I ended up needing to factory rest my phone thought since I bought the game it would be backed up on my Google account. Turns out I lost all my progress, didn't have to buy it again. I have to start over and I had 3 goals left."
Static Syndic8,7/16/2020,"I absolutely love this sequel! I really loved the original but this one is like 10x better! I would ask for 3 things though: 1) for purchases to be *slightly* cheaper 2) the ability to change your friends names in pass and play 3) and finally, the feature of kicking a player in online multiplayer if they are afk and replace them with a robot Besides that I love to see this game grow! <3"
Joshua B.K.,3/12/2022,Game is pretty bad. Watched the game move me countless occasions to the wrong spot. Count is off. Players constantly hitting back to back to back perfect rolls. Youll barely have a fighting chance. To top it off is 4.99$ for any new maps. No thanks. Instant uninstall.
Evan Tolstov,10/3/2020,"This is a great game. However, it tends to freeze up on my turn quite a bit. It'll just keep being stuck in the screen until enough time passes when the game will play for me, at which point all I have left to do is just exit the game. It's a fun game, but it's sad that this is an issue. It keeps happening pretty often."
Christine Wagner,6/18/2021,Fun and addictive. All the tradition game with a few more surprises. All the different options for cars and outfits are awesome. Also i love how it doesnt just give the traditional male and female options. There is a 3rd option that is both. For marriage the game gives an option to wear a suit with a veil. Very cool game. I love that I can coop with my family and friends or even play up to four characters on the same device. Very very cool ;)
Zak Robinson,7/15/2020,I've really enjoyed this game... the creators have obviously put alot of time and effort into this :) I would recommend the buy... I just played a second game and one of the players took an extremely long time to spin the spinner... so just in case some leaves the game I believe that a timer on the spinner section would make a great addition to the game but no worries if you can't
Jeff (Euphoria),5/2/2023,"I thought this game would be at least AS good and have as much depth as it's 98 counterpart. The game is trash. Can't believe I paid for it. No depth at all. Things happen and nothing matters. It's so short. You can complete a game in 5 minutes. I rolled 1 after 1 and the game only lasted for 15 minutes. Tldr: short, boring, life ripoff, every other feature other than base game locked behind about 100$ in pay wall, Short."
Kersten Bartelt,3/22/2022,I like the game pretty well but had bought a single map expansion then the season pass to get them all. A few days later I got the season pass refunded and lost access to all the extra maps. Not happy and not sure who to reach out to about it.
Dani O,1/3/2021,"It's a fun game but the grow your family puzzle board is so hard to achieve. In the original board game we had to spin to see if you got single, twins, triplets at the end of the child segment, bring that back. Also give us more options for kids (if you land on space if you choose kids, spin to see the number of kids you'll get) or including getting married as grow your family. I purchased all the boards and upcoming boards so I'd love to see more options to grow the family."
Josh Choppin,4/12/2021,"You have to pay for everything. Not just the initial game, but everything else too. Plus the challenges aren't challenges. Grow your family 30 times isn't a challenge. It just takes away your choices and makes you wait for luck of the spinner. Win a 4 player online match is a challenge."
Cody Harrison,10/19/2020,"It's fun, but I should have looked into it more before purchasing a VIP pass. The additional worlds are the same as the main content; they just have different themes. Replayability is very lacking - especially if you purchase new worlds."
Nell Wils,3/26/2023,"It's more modern and better graphics and more options than the first digital Game of Life. Definately love it. Go ahead get it and see if you like it too. That's how much I like it... Gonna do a small little advertising for them... How I get like a little gift for that... Hint, hint. 😁"
Jennifer Matte,4/5/2021,Fun and no in your face adds. I got this game so I would have something to play with mom as we sit together and it works out perfectly for that we use pass and play. The dlc maps have different careers which is fun . I felt it was a worthy investment for the bit of variety it adds though every map is the same (probably for online compatibility)
Bianca,9/9/2020,I live the board game and I was enjoying this version but I uninstalled it due to the fact that it seems like some people are able to cheat. I've played several games where other players have been able to spin multiple times to get a preferable number. The final straw was when it was my turn and the wheel spun before I touched it then landing on someone's lucky number but I was still able to spin to get another number.
ro cc,1/20/2021,"The game itself is ok. The thing i dislike is the people playing it. There should be a 30 second timer implemented. If you don't move turn skipped. 3 strikes your out from being afk. Last few games we would be waiting like 3 minutes before someone would do a single spin, 3 minutes before they press the confirm button, and not skip a single scene when they are being that ignorant. I did rage quit because of it."
jessica caves,7/15/2020,"After pointing out a few issues and the prompt and useful response of the developers I have changed my score to 5 stars. This is a brilliant family game that is easy to use, and with the different game modes (single, pass the phone and online) there is a way to play for everyone. I love the diversity and the fact this classic game has been brought into the 21st century to be more inclusive. Well done team 😀"
Tyson Gibson,4/16/2023,"Lots of fun, great graphics and nice add ons. Like that I can make choices. One minor complaint: some players are manipulating the spinner which is irritating. Seems like that could be fixed. Otherwise great game!"
Stephen Callans,10/28/2020,The game is pretty fun. I bought the package with all the boards and now it won't let me play the single player mode. I have to pass and play or play online. Can you fix this? Update: had to uninstall and then reinstall he game. Works ok now. Does freeze from time to time. Not sure why. Pretty fun though.
Shannon Sihtam,4/10/2021,Its not too bad but as many others mentioned you are paying for the original one only. They charge for everything else. I also think its a bit short. I think they should have options for longer or shorter games and more than 4 people. I also agree there's a lot of repetition so I would like to see a bit more diversity in the content.
Kellie Walker,11/9/2020,It's fun but the options are limited and there are more modes within the game you have to pay more for. It shouldn't be that hard to make more career options or something? Also constantly crashes and says there is no internet when there is.
Laurissa Chipman,2/16/2021,"Misleading with the trailer. Not nearly as interesting or interactive. Dont see how this game can be 5$ more then the game of life (which I also have paid for ) when this game is extremely similar aside from a few things. Will change to 5 star if they resind to my email. But not worth 7$ considering it's not much diff from the first one. Again, trailer was very misleading for the interactive part. Would have preferred life vacation"
Tejas Karandikar,1/20/2021,"The game is great but the only issues are that the game sometimes freezes and lags at most of the stages... Also the original way of spinning the dial should be brought back in order to decide who plays first... Other features that need to be introduced are, actual players in single mode by random matching and also more worlds, but for free..."
Alexa Wermuth,7/13/2021,"This game is a lot of fun! Its just really hard to have kids which is my favorite part! You will be lucky if you get 1 kid during the game, 2 is pretty rare. Once I got 5, but I've never had 3 or 4. I also wish you could have twins like in the real game. Overall I really love playing this, you can play online with real people, online with friends, alone with fake players with computer generated moves, or you can play with friends in the same room as you with ""pass and play."""
Cael Schipper,3/12/2023,"It is an awesome game with so many maps. Just one thing, I wish they would update and add more content, and change up the map. I know they have different maps, I just wish they had a different route than the single route all the maps have"
Elena Vigil,7/15/2022,"Do not purchase! Although you already bought the game, it only comes with one map. After that it is 5 dollars for each additional map. In reality a $30 dollar game that isn't worth it! Update! Then they contacted me explaining that it is because you pay for "" cosmetic in app purchases"". How about you advertise it that way from the beginning and stop stealing people's money for 1 boring map"
Johnna Guillerman,10/26/2020,"Really fun but I think people might be cheating? Just strange when people roll perfectly every time. Also they should have an option for people to play different maps. Not just cosmetic changes but changes and additions to length, paths, etc"
Jinxie Joelle,12/31/2022,"Addictive game but many bug issues and drains the battery quick , put my phone to charge as I been playing more then 30 minutes and my battery went from 88% to 12% , I even had it on charge and my phone become hot with less battery percentage at 6% 😳and my friend experienced the same issue.... also should be and kick out or reload player options for players that don't press ready or lose connection when joining online.. otherwise I would say 5 stars .. please look into this issue. Regards"
Holly Bunn,8/10/2020,While playing the game it freezes and I have to exit out and get back into the game even than it freezes about 4 more times before I can finish the game I love the game when it freezes on single player mode (waiting for a player) it makes me not want to play it anymore
C F,4/18/2021,The game is super quick and the board is really small. Dont expect to be able to buy a house and have more than one child because the spots for those are very limited. I played this 4x and had practically identical gameplay each time. Waste of money in my opinion
Makayla Garcia,2/23/2021,I really like this game. Can you put more colors and clothes and hair for free. So we can get them with the books and hearts and pigs. Or getting more stuff with them. My daughter and I play together. We got the three roads to play on and we enjoyed the game a lot. But it should be more free stuff and more roads also to play on. We haven't play together like this for a long time. We both enjoy the game so much. But it does need the hurry up button and the smiles also. That be great to add
Pell Torr (Borzonslayer),1/30/2021,"As far as I can tell, the game deliberately shorts the player in solo play, handicapping you on every spin while all computer players get the best possible jobs they can, move around the board at twice your speed, and all focus different point goals so you can never have anything in your favor. Screw this game and it's deliberately suppressive rng."
Amber Wright,8/15/2021,"So far I like the game. I bought the season pass, thinking it would be fun to host the games and play with my kiddos. When i do the online with frienda, i am the only one on the different board, and makes them in the classic board. Me being the host, you would think it would share the board for the game. But it doesnt. Only way to do it is pass n play. Im frustrated."
Amanda Rok,8/3/2020,"What a waste of money. Game worked perfectly when I was getting my ass kicked. As soon as I waa going to win a single game, it froze after showing money earned and didn't progress to points earned or who won the game. I do not give negative reviews often, but I also do not spend money on games often. Don't waste your money!!!"
Chevyguy,9/9/2020,The game for the most part is good. But when playing multiplayer on either android or ios it has a tendency to either crash or freeze. It is a little frustrating. Hopefully that can be fixed soon.
Matrix -Mega,4/20/2022,This game is fun but there is actually no system that times out players when they go afk for large amounts of time. There has to be a system that will kick the player after like 2 minutes of inactivity. Or a timer because this problem is so terrible people will go afk on purpose because they are losing and they game is close to the end. Everytime I play just last game someone went afk for over 10 minutes near the end I screen recorded about 1 minute. THe problem is so bad I can only give it a 1⭐
Megan Anderson,4/27/2022,Too short. Anyone else having issues at the end of the game where it doesn't break down the totals? It just stands there and doesn't do anything at times... have to reset the game too often. I had this problem with the first version too sometimes... this should be fixed by now...
Eric Williams,1/7/2021,"This game is amazing! Needs a loop effect to keep playing longer until bankrupted or stop at old age. Just like the feeling of playing the actual board game without all the hassel. Great graphics n choices. Also, needs more choices to choose from."
Shelley Balsley,11/30/2020,The game keeps freezing up and I have to quit and then load save game. Beyond that the game could be a little more animated with the choices. I would have rated the game a 3 or 4 if it would quit freezing though.
Blakie Boy,11/29/2020,"The game is Overall Fun,exciting and entertaining.I had A nice time playing it with friends and family with the pass and play mode, However in my opinion The game slightly lacks customization,There is not that much to buy and What there is Is Really OVER PRICED (In my opinion).If You can add a little more Things in The Shop and Not make 1 Mape Really Expensive For some,Just lower thing a little and Frequently update the game and maybe Make A bigger map."
April H,3/16/2021,"Its a good game with no real issues experienced. My reason for the rating is similar to everyone else. Do not waste your money buying this because all you get is the base level board. All other boards cost money, just like the first version of this game. Unless you're prepared to ultimately fork out around $50 which is the cost of a physical board game, this is not worth ANY money. It should be free to download, and it shouldn't cost as much as it does for new boards."
Kookie's cookie,8/13/2021,"Game is great and so fun. However, lately, my single games keep freezing and I don't get anything from them. Even if I ""Save and Leave"" when I get back it opens a new game and all the progress is gone. I hope this issue can be solved so I can play."
Samin Ali,12/25/2020,I got this game last month during a sale for 50p and I am going to explain my experience from then up to now. First of all purchasing this will only get you 1 board and 1 set of tokens if you want to get more boards and tokens you have to get them separately or in small bundles or buy the season pass which gives you access to all of their current and future boards and tokens. The gameplay is overall pretty fun with cute cinematics. The 1 thing I want is for the boards to be longer.
Ryan L,12/19/2020,"In spite of other reviews that mention the cost of the game being pricey for one board, it's a good game. I think it's actually kind of reasonable considering the life physical board game gives you one board for -$20+. It's a fair price in my eyes. My fiancee and I enjoy passing the game to eachother and competing against the bots. She loved the life board game and got me into it, and this is even better!"
Caitlin Reisinger,12/14/2020,"I was just playing the fantasy world version in multiplsyer online, and someone named ""BigPP"" got the ""app developer"" job from the original world IN fantasy land, it never had the right graphics when they spin, and now I can't open Google play. I've turned my phone off and on again 3 times and attempted access through settings, chrome, and other games. Google play won't load. I assume it's to prevent me from reporting this but then I left my phone alone for 5 minutes and was able to report this"
tiffy,1/31/2021,"*update Issue was handled well, good customer service and it was an error in wording. All good.🖤 Purchased the Haunted Hills Bundle which came with the world, +8 collectibles to get throughout playing, 6 vehicles, 9 avatars, and 9 outfits but only received 2 vehicles, 3 outfits, and 3 avatars as if I had only purchased the expansion pack."
Ash B,10/5/2020,"My kids and I love this game. And its a fast paced game at that, yes it cost money but if your kids like being on their like mine do then this is a way for all not to have to go through the whole get off your phone thing, plus have family time where everyone is happy and spending time together! Can't put a price on that! Not even $2.orb$3. Or $4. Or $5.99!!!!"
Lil Red DeadHead,7/4/2021,"Grade and always entertaining! With new options putting a twist on the game while still keeping the integrity of classic game of Life. The season pass is also a definite plus! Got it on sale and have not had to buy a single expansion yet, and there's already been four! Highly recommended for anyone of any age for casual entertainment and fun."
kurt cyr,11/30/2021,Way to go guys!! You made a classic into an updated turd no one wanted. This game was one of my favorites. I tried to play this for the first time today and I couldn't even finish college before wanting my money back. Unfortunately I missed that refund window and now im stuck with a game I'll most likely never open again. Keep up the terrible work. And rot in pieces updated game of life.
Yup,8/11/2021,"The game is fine, and pretty clean. 2 stars mainly for the fact that you pay 4 dollars thinking you're getting the full game, but instead get a single world, and the rest of the dozen or so are 5 dollars (even more than the game!). I feel like I bought a demo. The smaller issue is all online play is disabled. Why? If there's a reason, tell me why in the game so it doesn't annoy me constantly."
Thomas Ecker,5/8/2023,"This is an interesting remake of the classic board game, but... all of the new features simply detract from the game play for me. The taxes are an interesting twist, but the personality attributes, the collectibles... They're a little much."
Sam MaC,9/19/2020,"My problem with the game is that I purchased the Fantasy board, but it didn't say that it was only for a limited time. This board cost more than the game...That was a waste of money, now if I want to play it again I'll have to repurchase it?! You all should be ashamed of yourself for ripping people off like this....Not HAPPY AT ALL!!!!! 😒 😕 😑 😐 🙄 😒"
Erika Wilcox,7/16/2020,"First time playing game of life on mobile & it's a really smooth, pleasing experience. I wouls say that making the game a little more interactive in the future, like the ability to add friends, some type of leaderboards, would help keep people engaged & wanting to play long term."
Bhutwheyt Therismor,9/26/2021,"I had it at two because it wouldn't stop freezing, then it froze three more times in a row. A friend of mine is having the same issue. I don't like that I payed for something that doesn't work. If it gets fixed I'll buy the season pass, but it's unplayable until then."
Lady Burst,7/13/2021,"First of all it lost all my progress,has no button to contact support . i had to buy the game twice! And ive lost so many unlockables and 30 or more so dollars! Update! I contacted support they told me there is no way or restoring it nor giving me my money back. So if i wish to get back to where i was ill need to invest 20 hours or game time and give them more money for something i paid for. Super greedy!"
Jennifer LaRousse,3/5/2021,I've only been able to play it once since I've downloaded. It crashes everytime I try to open it. This isn't the first time either. I shouldn't have to uninstall and install again over and over. Reinstalling does no good when you use in-app purchases and those don't count when forced to re-install.
Marky Mark,7/22/2020,"Only been playing for a few hours, but for $3.50 and no ads, with all the new additions, I can't complain much. Although, my only complaint thus far is that I'm fairly certain I'm playing with bots rather than actual people when playing online...I switched to another app on my phone several times during an online game, only to find the previous player still on their turn, on the exact same space they were when I changed to a different application..it should be made clear to us if they use bots."
Jason Hicks,3/22/2021,"This game seems to delete all of your save data between updates. Combined with the fact that this app doesn't use the Google Play Games achievement system, any progress is meaningless. This is a game breaking bug and inexcusable for a game with expensive DLC."
Matthew Scatchard,8/23/2020,"Love it, but 2 things 1: sometimes the game freezes so i have to quit the app and reload it 2: sometimes it displays the wrong amount of money I have Fix these and then I'll give 5 stars!! Can't wait for more themes to play through"
Drake Featherwing,7/18/2020,"Good, but the maps feel way too short for the content the game has, the only other board available at launch is locked behind a $5 USD paywall... Will consider buying again when development progresses a bit more, but for now, had to refund and uninstall as it didn't hold my attention as expected."
VK x,1/10/2021,"Game feels rushed, it ends way too fast and the spins don't seem random at all. Would like to see the old PC game from 98' brought back to mobile and remastered. That was way more fun to play."
Jordan Kananen,8/10/2020,"Such a disappointment. The game board is much too short, you play through two or so times and you're already bored of the game, becomes very repetitive. Game would be much better if the board was longer or if there was additional boards that were included."
Kelly Walker,4/9/2022,Very disappointed in this game. Was defiantly not worth 6.99. The Game never changes . It's always the same jobs no matter what route you take. You need to spend more money to play on different board game backgrounds. Huge disappointment. I want a refund.
Ris AR,2/14/2021,Very addictable... I love the board game and this works for a phone game too. Totally worth the price. Brilliant game. I wish you could send simple prompt messages to hurry up the players - a 4 player game can take a long time. I would also like to send simple emojis to interact with the online players. Lastly the game won't start until all players are ready. Please add a time limit or start the game with less players...
D,2/4/2021,"You have to pay to unlock new worlds, I thought they would be longer or extended but its the same repetitive thing with a different theme. When you collect all the collections, it should unlock another lengthier level."
Megan Buchanan,5/19/2021,Fun but waste of money. You only get access to one board after paying $4 and have to pay more for locations. That is not fair. I deleted and requested a refund. Make the first board free and then you could charge like $2 for the next one not $5.
Drax1s 7,9/26/2020,"It's a fun game to play with my SO. My complaint is with the lack of replayability, especially noticeable with the paid content. There is a lack of action space events that would add so much more replayability to the game. There is no new themed action spaces with the Fairytale Kingdom like ""Rescue a peasant from a dragon: collect 1 Heart"". Or "" Find treasure under a troll bridge: collect 1 Wealth. I'd buy the premium content if there were."
Janet Chil,7/17/2020,"I love this game so far. But what I don't like that you can't save your account. I have it installed on my android and my Chromebook, I use the exact same Google Account for both games but when I started playing on my Android, everything I had saved on my Chromebook was not on my Android phone. I'm disappointed about that. Please make it so we can link accounts. Thank you!"
Mike Carrigan,6/5/2022,"I cannot make the spinner ""spin"" on my phone. I can run my finger all around that spinner and it will go in a circle as long as I run my finger around it but as soon as I release it, it bounces back and forth and never spins...so I can't play. My wife plays just fine on our Chromebook and she players her sister across the county but it won't play on my phone."
Vanno Kouch,4/2/2021,"Great game overall. Don't listen to the complaints about the skins, they're just skins and cosmetics. But I would say I wish there was another real board that was longer, and it should have the option like the switch to continue after retiring."
UnicornVommit,7/19/2020,"Just learned that the season pass is considered an inapp purchase, meaning that in order for all 3 family member to have all the content I have to buy it 3 times after already paying for the app in the first place. (On sale for 29.99 right now.) So almost 100 bucks for everyone while its on sale... Can we at least get to try a map before buying it. Geez what a money pit."
Mrz. Renee,4/14/2021,"I absolutely love this game, it's extremely addicting! The only thing that I wish it did have, where the emojis like the first game of life. I also had the issue where when I changed new phones even though it was with my email and I purchased the season pass none of my avatars that I had earned didn't roll over not to start all over again 😔"
Daph,3/24/2021,"It's so much fun the game could be a little more smoother and it would be nice if you didn't have to pay for the other boards you should be able to earn it, but if you can't do that then at least lower the price cause I don't wanna pay 5 dollars for it, other then that it's a great game if you could take my suggestions then I would definitely give this game 5 stars."
Rebecca PriceLarison,9/7/2022,"Good game, there needs to be more variation in jobs. And I wish the jeep was an option for vehicles instead of just one of the transformations. And I would like to be able to choose the animal or color of baby I'm getting."
Colleen Trump,8/15/2021,"The game freezes constantly. You can't get to any other boards unless you pay. I thought maybe you could when you win all the collectibles, but that doesn't do anything at all. Pretty disappointing considering I had to pay for this app."
Turdy TurdPiles,8/26/2022,"Constant crashes. Worst thing is that if your game crash, you can't go back to your current game. You are forced to start a new game. On top of that, you are unsure if you are playing with real players or a bot. If you crash, the bot will play it for you. Repetitive and it gets boring after a while."
Abyss Gaming YT,3/11/2021,"The game is brilliant for family as well as the graphics are good, gameplay is good however I think the game is limited to a free to play who only brought the game. I think a good way is to have a second free environment (as the only free environment is the default) that can be unlocked by unlocking all puzzle pieces from the default map. I say this because it would spice the game up for free to play people as well as make the game more interesting."
Caleb Carr (Teaer),8/2/2020,"Game constantly freezes on other players loading screens. The puzzle pieces for creating a family is hard to complete, since landing on those squares is hard. The fantasy board needs more immersion. Game is fun when it is working."
F. PWALYM,4/19/2021,"This is good, but can you make it more complex like The Game of Life (1998)?? Also the game is so often to freeze, especially after a player/computer moves... Fix this please... Or can you make New Version of the game?? With the same energy just Like ""The Game of Life (1998)"" on Playstation One/PSX...."
Pam tatum,6/24/2023,"It's a fun game me and my family play it on family night, but we are unable to change our names in the game it just says ""Player"""
Caleb Carter,2/2/2021,Game freezes (I'm literally on a new generation phone) constantly and it's repetitive and boring. Its too fast to end and too slow to play. Not with $1 let alone its actual price of $3.99. Any and all dlc is $4.99. Highly unrecommend this.
Catherine Vestorp,2/7/2022,Love the game but it constantly crashes everytime it goes through the four players. I spend a lot of time waiting for it to load and less time playing the game. Seriously!!! FIX IT or i will delete.
NightRay Eclipse,6/13/2021,"This is a great game and ramp up from the original. however it would be nicer to have a longer board. and for children/pets to give a bonus at the end of the game. Also can you please make it cheaper to buy the other maps, i think £4.99 is a bit of a rip off."
Sarah- Jane,3/16/2021,"I really like this game. However I can't seem to play single player, it used to work but now when I press the single player option it keeps jumping around the screen and won't let me play. I've tried uninstalling and clearing cache multiple times, but still nothing. Any ideas how to sort this?"
Tina Truong,3/16/2021,"Good game, worth it! But you should be able to kick people out for taking too long. There's no way to tell them to hurry up so a button to kick someone out would be good. If the rest of the players also agree by touching that button. They should get kicked out. I'm tired of waiting 5 minutes bc one person isn't paying attention"
Abi Kendall,7/17/2020,"Really enjoying the game, although i seem to be encountering a few problems on the online multiplayer games, after a few turns i can no longer pick any of the cards for example i graduate from college but the game won't let me click on the job cards, i can press anything else but the job cards becoming very frustrating."
Henry Hobbs,7/15/2020,"This is a great sequel to the original game of life. I'm really impressed with how polished the game feels on day 1. I didn't encounter any issues while playing. The gameplay itself stays true to the original, while giving the player some more agency so it doesn't feel like a pure game of luck the way the classic game does. I'm a little put off by the day 1 DLC but I've come to expect it from this developer, and its of course not necessary to enjoy the game."
joey chung,10/2/2021,"This game is not allowing Online with Friend function the second time when i open this game! Whats going on?? Can adminstrator fix this?? ( I had the exact same problem with Monopoly, and it was fixed a week later after I left feedback like this. Hopefully it works again!) Thanks"
Shannon Cote,1/22/2021,"it's just okay! many missed opportunities... The action cards shouldn't be the same in all lands. There's not enough on the board to keep entertained. Roll a 10 you skip over all the babies(the fate wheel is a chance but mostly get taxes) There aren't enough chances to buy a house. There's not enough content. It's job, marry, taxes, action(repeats)I got the same action in one game 7+ times, fate. It's like playing the same game over & over. It needs more!"
ohwaizo,2/25/2021,"just played my first game, was GREAT. wayy better than the super old app version. fully delighted about the reboot! <3 so many things to do, so many options, new things, and STILL holds the integrity of the original boardgame. 《3 I appreciate the creators to do this! I would love a refund from the old version though.. it was unplayable .. and I have a Galaxy S10+. Again, Thank Y'all!!"
Explorer SJ,4/25/2023,So far so good. But can be improved. Like if we could rotate Avatar while on map to see who is sitting at back seat. Audio chat during a game feature. More options to choose opponent and take their money like suit file etc.
Anthony Young,5/6/2023,"Good game, Nice graphics fun game, bought it on the back on mouse trap giving our small family of 3 loads of sofa fun and multiplayer fun when I'm away working. This however is a paid game with the option of a £30 upgrade....£30 for a mobile game and some extra boards. Had I of seen this I wouldn't have bought as I can't stand company's who are add on heavy and this game is a sumo wrestler when it comes to heavy. Fun to pass the time with family but expect a child asking for the upgrades."
Flordeliza Salazar-Quilates,6/20/2023,First time playing this game and it was fun though sometimes the board glitches and shows the wrong number but overall 100/10
James van Rijn,2/3/2023,"Absolute rip-off. You pay for the game only to find out that it gives you access to just the first map and nothing else. All other maps require purchasing. The game doesn't last long enough either. Absolute waste of money. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
Babay Lan,8/13/2023,I love it very much...I already purchase the Fairy Tale Kingdom and Haunted Hills...looking forward for more features....
Melanie Turnbull,11/13/2022,"It's a decent game. Just know you only get one map for free which I find reasonable because when you buy the game in store you also only get one board. I purchased the skins pack and it's been very cute and kept it interesting. It's great to not have to set up, pack up, or read the rules 😂 this game is eligible for Family Sharing, as is their suite of Marmalade board games, so give it a try! Good customer support, too."
Cakey Online,4/3/2023,"I absolutely love this, and have now got all 3 of us siblings playing long distance using the in game cam and mic. It is just so easy to use and so much fun. And I'm addicted to playing against AI and unlocking all the stuff. Can see myself buying all the maps for sure"
6th Face,11/29/2023,Fun enough. But microtransaction hell.
Courtney Davis,1/7/2022,"I have the first game of life as well. So that's two games I have bought from yall so far pluse I paid for the season on the first one. Both of your games are laggy and freeze up, albeit the second one less. Just really disappointed in the fact that your games run so poorly."
PAL7OS G,6/23/2021,"It looks awesome, but the artificial lukk is quite suspicious. I haven't won 1st place against the computer players once. I'd rather play the actual board game nd have a real natural chance 2 win 1st place. Online is a little better, but it's still artificial lukk. Not a fan of that"
Matthew Lang,3/19/2023,"Wish there were more and varying maps, but I love this fun and highly replayable game. Must have played 100+ times in the last 6mo. One day, I'll even post online the results of a scientific experiment with 5 games I played and which variables yield what results (or not)."
Charity Kittelson,11/17/2021,"I'm going to stick with the original. While it's nice to play with friends online, 9/10 times when I play the computer, the computer will have a lead in career cards, bonus spaces and overall wins. Not a fan"
David McGrath,8/25/2020,"Since the maps are smaller and we pay for add on maps, can you make it so we can play on multiple maps for a longer game? I guess I'd just like a bigger board or even add an option for a 1-6 spinner so we land on more of the board. Otherwise fun game guys keep adding to it.. I see your response, thanks"
Yolianne Rivera,7/26/2020,"They should improve the algorithm they use for this game. In the online game option the algorithm favors one of the players at all times and from the beginning, taking away any possibility of taking advantage of the other players. At least do not make it so obvious who is going to win, so the player keep motivated to try. I'm been trying this games a couple of days: only 1 win. Waste of money and time."
Anthony Rosa,10/13/2020,"Game is fun but it needs the original means of gaining points, having kids, having a house and having a degree. Basically going the point system back from the first game mixed with the new features from this one."
Erin Mullin,8/19/2023,"Love the game but I can't buy $,and we have no faces,lol loved playing this Bord game as a child an still do ..thank you. Erin M"
Al Henderson,2/10/2021,The thing is it's the same old same old. Even if you pay to buy a different quote on quote game it's still the same questions is still the same game so why do I want to spend $5 to be in Fairland or whatever they need to come up with a new and more exciting reason to pay for those new games. Maybe it's just me but new outfits a new vehicle to drive don't really excite me
Cheyenne,1/25/2021,"Horrible. There's a very limited amount of things to do in the game and it has a tendency to frequently freeze and force you to restart the app, which can lose progress you made."
Lucas Godfrey,7/15/2020,"Massive improvement over the first game and drops the dreadful and glitchy minigames at last!... however very VERY pricy season pass and I'm sure having the worlds, outfits, vehicles and avatars count as microtransactions, which they advertised there would be none of"
Aerin Hyacinth,7/22/2020,Only just got the game but have already been having so much fun! Love all the new functions and tons of new options. Really allows for a more diverse gameplay experience. Can't wait to eventually play this with friends and family as well! 🥰❤
Othmane El Alami (ɎøX),1/1/2022,"The basic game is just awfully repetitive and boring after few games, the online experience lack the ability to chat and people take too much time to play their turn. I'm not paying again for just a theme."
Charlie Walton,10/4/2022,I like this game a lot but it would be a lot more fun if you could get maps for rewards and maybe avatars and keep the prices so players get to choose. It would make them want to play it a lot more than just being able to play it. Players would be like I need to get 20 wins so I can get a new map instead of being like I might play a round then play minecraft and get some rewards to get some more skins
Gareth,12/31/2021,"One Star because despite being a fun experience the game unbelievablly doesn't save to the cloud. So if I unlock items on my phone they're not unlocked on my other devices. Why is it not linkable to Google or Facebook ? So if phone needs factory reset or is replaced, all your progress is GONE Simply not good enough in this day and age."
Jonathan Pike,11/2/2022,"Unless im missing something!! Would Love to give this more stars but I feel ripped off. In the game info it states very clearly that this a collection of 7 worlds. Start playing the game and right away see that u get the classic board and then the other game board worlds are only yours if u pay 4.99 a piece for them. Kind of a bait and switch on there part. Won't buy another game grom this company. Loved game of life 1, but feel jaded on this Game of life 2."
Jonny Soares,7/22/2020,"Game is great, however... I feel as though if someone is about to take your crown with attributes that they should not be allowed to go into debt or already be in debt to obtain the crown. I would also like to suggest that there be more opportunities to pay back debts and if you own a house and sell, if you have debts they should be deducted from your sale profits to pay them off or down. Also, a larger selection of job opportunities would be appreciated."
Samantha Musolino,8/2/2021,Extremely limited content for a paid game. Very little variation. And extra boards cost more then the game itself. You can make any excuse you'd like for the poor gameplay of this paid game but there are so many FREE game apps that provide an infinite amount of fun and options. And youre right the extra purchases don't affect the gameplay because there is none
Emily Koykka,1/2/2021,"Why does it cost more for additional worlds than for the app itself? When I purchased, I was expecting to get all of the content. Edit: I did not realise that the purchase-able worlds are only cosmetics for the base world. In that case, I wish this game had more worlds since the base board is too short and gets boring quickly."
Emmie Bell,8/30/2020,"Game overall would be fun, if the lazy developers could fix the probability ratio; especially in single player mode, you'll never win against the bots. The game get monotonous, because the developers cant develop a game algoritm to save their lives. Spin the same # multiple times, get same category of tile, pick life path and never get to experience it. Very lazy game making. Dont waste your $, even if they paid you to play it. I usually dont leave reviews, but the simpleton level is🤦🤦🤦"
David Moore,7/19/2020,"Great so far! 2 things I would love to see is a friends list and the addition of asynchronous multiplayer. Would like to play with a friend even if we're both not immediately available. Only concern: there doesnt seem to be any kind of account sync, if I buy an IAP, what's my guarantee I dont have to buy it again when I get a new device?"
Ali Mashal,8/3/2023,Great game but I wish at the end we would get money for the amount of action cards and pets we have like in the first game
CROWNTAN IO,10/8/2023,Great game. It's fun to play when you are bored and please make the next sequel (free!! Free?)
Ibn Muhd,8/30/2023,Two stars. For a good interface. But a boring one. Slow paced with a very short playtime. Repeated gameplay with a limited options. It's not worth it.
Hailey Wilson,6/20/2023,I was able to download and it's fun to play and a great way to pass time. Though single player is boring after a while and robots can take a long timenotherwise I have no more problems.
Amethyst Oncer,12/12/2020,Really liked this game but when I transferred it to my new phone all my collection progress was reset to 0. I had all but 1 thing in halloween almost all fairytale and classic and at least 2 pieces of everything from winter. Pleas help.
Asia Ayers,6/13/2021,I absolutely loved this game as a child so it's nice that I can have these memories back although these maps are way to short you could roll all tens and be done in 5 rounds it's sad. There should be an option for long term game or such.
Amanda Taylor,8/16/2020,The games is good but it keeps freezing when playing against computer. I would like fast forward when playing online as I'm bored waiting. The game could be longer. More chances to buy houses and have children and pets
Jade Lavigne,9/1/2021,I could have gave a 5 stars if it was not that I lost everything I've bought when I've changed my phone. That's really annoying cause I've paid for many things and they are all gone without any way to retrieve them. That's really disappointing. If you buy the game never buy anything in it or you'll loose it.
matt,9/14/2020,"This game is not worth spending your money on. It constantly crashes in the middle of games which is quite infuriating. Games that are free can never crash. The fact that this company asks you for money is absurd for what you actually get. The Game can be fun when it works, but right now it sucks a lot."
Florence Deadly,8/17/2020,"Love the updates, they added skills so it's not just about money. You can also get a Master's degree and that's amazing. It goes pretty fast which I'm deducting a point for, but you can always play again and again...."
JJ Patterson,9/4/2021,"A really good way to connect with family around the country during COVID. We have 3 generations playing each week; the game moves fast and we like the modern touches - you don't have to get married and expanding your family can include pets. Don't love that new boards cost money and only the buying player gets to see them. The thing that would give it 5 stars is if they regularly added new professions / houses / Action cards to keep it interesting. But really, we just use it as a framework for Grandparents and grandkids to talk every week."
Austin Ward,5/6/2023,"Although I like the game of life, it's missing the core value that the original game of life on the play store had that came out forever ago and does not feel the same. Also that game seems to last alot less than the original. Only played one game of online multiplayer and one game of single player and I already regret buying this game. Can I get a refund?"
Heidi Zungrone,2/26/2021,It's fun for a round or two but I feel like a lot is missing from the original board game. I never land on having kids and I've had games without the chance to buy a house. I wish the game were longer with more options. It gets old fast.
Meghan and Tyler Meszaros,11/2/2022,Good morning. I have recently purchased Game of Life vacations and cannot install it on my devices because it was removed from the play store. I would appreciate a refund. I have already tried a refund for google play refund and they have denied me. I have since purchased this version but the right thing to do would be to either refund me or you could give me a free copy of Game of Life 1 on the play store. Thx
M L,1/13/2021,"Its ok. A pretty short game wish it was longer. & why does the purple person wear a suit & not a dress? Maybe there should be a green option that wears a suit, so the pink & purple can wear dresses. All the outfit options are kind of horrible actually."
Joshua Wood,11/26/2023,Brilliant game. Really good to play with the fam
Tracey Steele,10/9/2022,"Love the game. Only disappointment, I bought the Fairytale Kingdom world and though they changed the world and the jobs, they didn't bother to change anything else. I would have loved to see new chance cards and even maybe different pets."
Andres Salazar,12/28/2022,It's fun to play and I love it but it's could be better if if I can customize my own vehicle and outfit and change colors to the outfit and other stuff and need more free stuff that doesn't cost me or anyone anything and add more free places and outfit and other stuff and it's would be cool if we can customize the places and other stuff and things please 🙏🏽 think about it?
Ari's Adventures,8/22/2020,It's a fun game for a few rounds. I wished I looked how many downloads before buying it though. The online game play is awful and the app just links you up with fake players. You might as well just play offline against the computer smdh. Well thats $4 down the drain pretty much.
Peter Ferguson,7/16/2020,"Bit cheeky! Pay to start, sale price for me to begin with, but if you want another board give us a fiver...and I can only guess that they will want more cash for each board that's released. TBH I don't think it's really worth the cash to begin with. This should be a free game then charge a couple of quid for additional boards if you want to. I also find myself getting a bit bored in a game anyway. Boardkings is better imo. Love the board game but sorry Devs.. app version isn't for me."
Zera Streams,9/6/2021,"I came here from all the mad reviews to tell you the game is fine, they changed it to make it more interesting. The game isn't perfect or proven to make you feel good, it's made me bored while playing 1 game,I favor the first for it is simple. The maps on this one are very creative and it's great they listen to fans. I personally wish pets also could be turn into fairy tail creatures, bought this in 2020 came back 2021 all my stuff is there, it's just an okay game nothing more."
Regan Ford,9/16/2023,downloaded game onto laptop restarted it and all that and cant play no app for me to launch if you have a laptop do not recommend
Kenny Ooten,11/28/2022,Love the game but giving it one star cause you get only one free map you have to pay 5 bucks for each of the other maps total ripoff don't waste your time on this app it would cost and extra 40 bucks to get all the maps!! In
Sok Channoeurn,11/9/2023,Nice game to teach kids about life ❤️
Love My Furbabies,12/26/2022,"Players need to be on a timer! People quit or decide to go make dinner and we sit there waiting and waiting. I've had to quit so many games because of this. If a player doesn't spin withing 30 seconds to 1 minute, it needs to move on to the next person. So annoying and waste of time."
Jessica Hanson-Nelson (Jess),12/17/2022,"There are too many bugs. At first, it was a great game. Now, it won't even let me play. The game also started out horizontal, now it's vertical and hard to see. Uninstalling. Wasted 3.99 🙄"
Allison Higgs,7/20/2020,"Very cute game! Love that you can adopt pets!! I also enjoyed the different options you can choose when landing on certain spaces. The Game of Life is my favorite board game, so nice to see a new version come out!"
Samantha Kesler,2/6/2022,Would be better if you didn't have to wait for the robot players to go through actual turns and the boards are pretty short but other than that it's good entertainment for a round or two before the slowness causes frustration.
Trinette,7/17/2020,"I love it, It runs smoothly. The only problem that sometimes happens is when you change it to 5x it freezes and you have to reload it to continue. But other then that it's great."
Giovanna Leigh,12/4/2020,Wish I got it when it was on sell because its not worth the money I spent. When it works the game play is great but its constantly crashes on me or takes forever to load a new game. Really considering just getting a refund if they don't update soon.
Mikey B,8/20/2020,Do not buy this game. It's horrible and crashes constantly. If you play a game then it freezes. If you pay once for the app don't have people have to pay more for other boards. And I don't know how you totally messed up a classic game and made it boring and glitchy also. Don't be scared or offended. Just make a waaaaay better game.!!!
Gamer Bro,9/22/2023,I BOUGHT THE EXPANSION PACK ON THIS GAME TO GET ALL THE MAP SKINS AND OTHER STUFF BUT I PLAY THE GAME THE FIRST TIME WITH THE NEW MAPS BUT WHEN I WENT TO PLAY IT THE NEXT TIME CAN'T PLAY ON ANY NEW MAP ANYONE WHO PLAY THIS GAME DONT BUY AND THING ITS A SCAM
Maeve Teresa Mitchell,3/27/2023,A very graphics heavy and cartoon looking game. Though fun and runs or loads well. I would have been able to find this game version less time consuming if it was less interesting.
Lisa Maria,8/19/2020,"When it says you have three chances to pick an envelope when selling your houses there is only one chance. The game is ok. I want to see how the original was but don't want to spend more money for it when I have the newest version, which cost a bit more."
Bonnie Zellers,2/28/2021,"Good game, but I have suggestions. 1) entering my player name, using the letter ""Z"" gives an error as not a valid character. 2) While waiting on the computer's turn, the waiting banner bocks action cards and you can't read them. 3) Playing online with friends is nice IF you both can play live. I would like the option for taking turns at each other's leisure. 4) It be cool if your spouses or pets matched the world theme. E.g. adopt a dragon or a seal"
Silent Speaks,5/5/2021,The game of life is my favorite game. I have 3 different versions of it on my phone I have the old first edition . and I have the 2 new version by you guy part 1 and 2 I didn't bother getting the vacation one cuz i didn't like tjat version of it.but part 1 and 2 i love. I love part 2 so much when it first came out that I bought the season pass for it and it was $50 or $60. Now I get whatever for this game for free.. keep the awesome work going guys love these games
Brian Kramer,12/11/2021,It's the game of life. It's fun. What it really needs is for the themes to impact the spaces you land on. Why am I going to a vr museum in the Dino theme or camping in the space them. Seems like the themes are all half-assed. You guys could make this game so much more.
Melissa Bennett,8/10/2020,"I've always loved The Game of Life ever since I was a kid 😊 At 32, I have the board game and share the experience, fun and nostalgia with my kids ❤ When I found the first Game of Life on mobile, I HAD to have it! I loved how we could play the game anywhere, anytime and it would save our game. Then, The Game of Life 2 came out, so I pre-registered and got it as soon as it was available. I love the game and recommend to EVERYONE to get not only the mobile app, but the board game also."
M01R4H7,8/21/2020,"I'm lovin this game! First the graphics are so HD which makes the gaming experience REALLY GOOD!! Second it's so fun to play this game I can even play it with my friends! Third, I am so into fantasy genres. And seeing as how they added a fantasy world in this game is the cherry on top of it's perfection!! It's the reason that made me buy this game! The fantasy world!! Aaaaahhhh!!!~☆"
Rob,10/10/2020,"Honestly kind of disappointed in this game. I know games change over the years but I really expected this to be alot more like the old game I remembered from super Nintendo. This is some sort of toddler dumbed down version that doesn't even resemble the original game play. Clearly liberally designed, it flat out says this game isn't just about money anymore. Ill stick to monopoly where the objective is more based in reality."
T R,9/6/2023,"Maps and skins cost to much, only complaint."
Juan Morales,3/6/2021,It's a really fun game to play especially on multiplayer with friends. My only issue was playing online with other people who just went afk during a game because they did not want to pay taxes. I think there should be a limit on the amount of time it takes to click on the number to pay taxes.
Gregory B,7/16/2020,"So far its pretty fun, reminds me of when I played this as a kid. Havent played online yet, looking forward to it though. It is a shame that you cant pause between rounds to look at the other players stats."
Liz Hockensmith,11/19/2023,Really fun it's better then the first one I love it definitely get this
Charlie Hutchinson,11/6/2020,"Fun game, I like how you can play it offline with AI if you don't have data. Only giving 4 stars because for some reason I can't put it on my SD card or the game keeps crashing, this is the only game that does that. Asides from that fun game."
Monsieur Dystopie,12/22/2020,"I loved this board game when I was a kid, and this is a good time killer although a bit repetitive, if this had more variety in events and jobs (for some reason I always get the same 2 jobs over and over) I hope they update this and give more variety to jobs"
Silent Speaks (J-LAP),11/4/2021,I really love this game and the monopoly game and bought the season pass for both games.. But I am really hoping they put in more game board soon. I am hoping for another Halloween board since it passed or any awesome boards.. cuz this game only has 5 boards and monopoly has 8... plz put more boards to this game. Other then that keep up the awesome work..
Heather Wittig,11/12/2020,"You guys should really consider the option to play a long game or a short game.....I feel like it was wayyyyy to short and you should have repeat options like if you choose family instead of college, you should have the option to choose college after family. Please make EXTENDES version."
Drip Muzic,10/19/2023,It's a really fun game you guys should try it I definitely recommend it
Trickster,10/14/2023,"Visual glitch, unplayable"
Makenzie Rhodes,10/5/2023,Worked awesome till i cleared my data and lost all the worlds i once bought
Shay Lovelace,9/1/2021,"The game is fun and i love all the different boards and costumes. I purchased the season pass a while ago and, several months later, still not a single additional world? Come on, guys."
Samblam0,2/6/2021,"Great game. My problem is with the family squares. I'v never gotten more the 2 kids/pets in one game. To few family squares. You can get them in the family path, but theres only a few of them, and if you roll a decently high number you skip over the whole path. The fate squares also give a chance, but even when you do land on one its a slim chance to roll on family. Maby a stop square similar to the one in the board game at the end of family path to roll for twins/triplets ect. Or twin squares."
Manaia Bucknell,8/24/2020,"Kinda glitchy. So my sisters and me where playing on our phones together and all the sudden my phone is stuck waiting for the others to spin, but apparently as mine was still waiting, the other 2 kept going and the computer took over plaing for me. They even showed it spinning and making moves for me. Not cool"
Been Dead,7/18/2020,"Was really excited to play this game, but when I start one the game doesn't just crash, it also completely restarts my phone. I've tried this 4 or five times now and also uninstalled and reinstalled the game. Nothing seems to work. Wish I didn't pay for this app."
Ashley Edington,10/16/2020,Disappointed. I was so looking forward to this game as LIFE is one of my favorites. But playing online multiplayer is not set up well. There are no turn timers so you can be stuck waiting a long time on someone else.
William Lim,7/22/2020,"It's a massive improvement from the prequel of this game, but the gameplay could be a bit boring and repetitive, and also it's very pricy for the Season pass, Overall it's very good but needs more improvement of the gameplay."
Joey King,9/17/2022,Don't waste your time or money. You can almost never finish a game because it keeps freezing and never loads. It is way too glitchy to be a game that requires payment.
Brant Gisi,2/13/2023,"Totally lame. You pay for the game, and only get one level, then have to pay for the others, each time. The computer always spins higher than you. I wish I never purchased this. I want my money back."
Lynn Siraco,9/6/2022,"I like it! Very cute characters and a ""speed-up/skip"" button if you want the game to go faster. I purchased Life Vacations and was very disappointed. This version has restored my opinion of the Game of Life games."
Jim McDowell,7/31/2021,Among the most unbalanced games I've ever tried to play. The ONLY time I spun anything higher than a 2 was when I only needed to move 1 space. Meanwhile the AI was spinning exactly what they needed 3 out of 4 times
Kayleigh Hodges,9/14/2020,Its good fun but i am always last place its like the algorithm doesnt work properly as the same position of players is always first but otherwise good fun. Shane there isnt more you can do without having to keep paying since i already paid for the game that is rather dissapointing that everything else must be paid for after.
Matthew Honea,9/28/2023,So much fun! Kids and adults can play together and have a great time. 👍
Seth Norvell (RobeeSeth),4/19/2021,"Pros: fun game, good graphics, able to play with friends on same device Overall it's better then the original board game Cons: small board, only one free board Very few cosmetics to start with. Yes I understand it's not required Overall 9/10 Would recommend buying"
BossInvader,7/20/2020,"Bought this specifically to be able to play with the kids (Google Family Account) when a physical boardgame isn't feasible, or the wife and I are just looking for some fun childhood games to play together. It is so far better than the original Life App Game, not that it was bad, just outdated and this is a lot more 'snappy', even on our basic free phones from our cell carrier! Great job!"
Dhairya Vora,9/19/2022,Kindly give some free content to play. All other maps are locked with real cash. Atleast give 3-4 maps as free so we can enjoy playing the game a little longer. Just downloaded yesterday and now I m bored. Just gonna say don't be much greedy and allow users to atleast have something for free or with in-game coins or something.
Jeri Sory,10/25/2020,Not worth the money. I was excited about it because I love the game of life but it's not very realistic with the characters which I don't like. And you only get one map with the purchase. Additional ones are 4.99 which is ridiculous.
Creid Reid,8/12/2023,I bout this n can't even play it it says start at the tital screen then a black box comes up n i cant do anything fix it or I want a refund
Michael Doleski,7/16/2023,Not a bad game at all worth the money you paid. Wonder if you will be making the game of life 3.
Rochelle Miskanis,6/27/2023,So much like the board game from my childhood. I aboslutely love and highly recommend.
Joseph Ruggiers,7/10/2023,The price is a rip off. $5 for every level in the game on top of the $5 just to play it?
Sheranda Wymore,10/22/2021,"I have tried reaching out to your support team with this game but it will not let me send anything to them. I have tried several times over the past few days. I bought the VIP pack however when the sandy shores board came in it locked me out of all of my boards, except for the Halloween one which I had previously bought. I have tried going back to your store and rebuying the pass however when I click on it. It tells me that I already have it. If I could just get my boards back...."
Angell White Banks,7/18/2023,Game is fun it gives u life choices and u make the decision on how u want ur life to turn out. Play with friends and family. It's enjoyable.
jayjewel 3,6/17/2023,This my go to game to play with my niece. She's 7 and absolutely loves it!
Chad Ritchie,8/13/2023,Since the last update game skips turns players spin twice.
Ray,7/27/2023,This updated version of the board classic is amazing!
Courtney Fitzgerald,8/18/2020,"Play all the time. A little laggy at points which is expected, but still a little annoying. Love the new updates especially the option to be a boy, girl, or other. Also, the kid OR PET option when you land on ""expand family"""
x_Shømïn_x,4/9/2021,Its a good game to play but some times players take too long to take their turn and the game got boring really quickly as the map isnt that big and there are not as many options as the one on PC and stuff i honestly wish i didnt spend money on it
Amber Hall,12/16/2020,It's alright. Kind of really disappointed that there is only one board theme that is free. The other's cost about $5 each. It gets boring all too quickly and I'm not paying that much just to not be entertained.
Noella Thurman,4/14/2021,"Love the board game and the mobile game. A bit of a rip off to have to pay for the game and the same amount for the world's & such. But game play is smooth, graphics are neat."
Christopher Stites,4/13/2021,"This game is extremely fun! The only thing I can suggest to make this game even better is the ability to text in a group chat or something, so that you're more into the game and making friends along the way. Waiting for your turn and not being able to chat with others can drag a game out sometimes"
bobbyx b,7/21/2020,Great game. Seems very polished. Something that would be nice to add is chat. At the very least be able to pick predetermined friendly chat messages. Also a 'poke' type button to get a players attention if they are taking to long spinning.
Michelle Ahaus,8/14/2022,Loved it but now all my items show not there my purchases are there but showing in half. I not happy! Lots of glitches when playing online with code. I can't even really play with husband anymore...not even a restore game progress or purchases button!
Roger Ng,7/15/2020,"Fun but animations are repetitive. If there was a toggle option for fast animations I would enjoy it more, rather than having to speed it up after every turn."
Ron Emerson Khai,5/11/2021,"Game is fun. But came across a cheater when playing online multiplayer. They kept going to a screen that said ""app developer"" in the corner and they somehow were taking duplicate turns in a row when their turn was over it would go back to them or skip other players."
Mrs. Sherri C,5/10/2022,"I never lose when I take the family route, I don't know what they are talking about! I love this game, I just wish it was longer. Plus paying $17.00 USD for everything to be unlocked is really expensive in my opinion!!!"
Brady McCown,7/22/2020,"Fun game, brings back alot of memories. However the biggest problem I have is it freezes in the middle of the game everytime i play, have to close the app then reboot."
Neighbor Please,9/4/2020,"The AI kept taking forever to make a choice, spin ect. I had to keep going to the menu to either load or restart the game, or even close the app entirely. I'm not sure why this kept happening."
M P,3/19/2022,"The additional boards lunar, haunted hills, etc are bugged. If you select get married, it doesn't acknowledge it and you stay single. The game is different from the original and gives no points for spouse/kids and has few buy house squares. It's not worth buying it and bugged."
Alex La Guidara,11/28/2020,The Map itself is very good I love the getting married bit. The quality is fantastic the only thing I don't like is the spinner it's not that random and sometimes I always through the entire board get low numbers. But the rest is good
Irene,9/19/2023,"This game, though I love it, makes my phone get super hot after just a few minutes of play. Yes I have tried to not hold the part that gets hot. I have loads of storage on my phone."
Mel,7/1/2022,Great classic game with pretty good graphics. A little different storyline which was cool along with some different options than we've seen from the game of life in the past.
Pamela Williams,3/22/2021,Love this game!!! Lots if fun short animations. Great game play. Wish there was an option to make the game longer such as a spinner wheel with numbers 1-5 and each number is two slots wide. But still love the game.
Shaun Campbell,2/6/2022,"Similar to the original but better animation, the prices at full price are similar to the original aswell, it the same game as is on Steam but at a reduced base price £3.49 Android and £9.99 PC (on limited sale of around £1.49 till 23:59 6th February), the Season Pass however at full price is the same as the PC version at around £24.99 (on limited sale of £17.49 til 23:59 6th February) and the DLC are the same full price of £5.99 each as PC. Good job I like it so I spent the money getting it."
steve carr,8/12/2020,"Great game, needs work. Game freezes about every third or fourth game forcing a restart. Otherwise it's a great way to spend some time."
BlueSoul •,8/17/2021,"Thanks so much to those leaving a review. Almost bought it then I looked at the reviews. I cant believe that stuff doesnt come included. It's in photos and I wish somewhere it would say those are add ons you can buy. Also the comments from the dev's are so weird. Everyone who loves the game gets a ""thanks so much, come message us with feedback"" and those who say issues and suggestions with a negative review kinda get brushed aside with the dev's replying. So weird."
Kyle Corden,11/11/2022,Need to make the rolls more random. Here's how you cheat...low high low high low high. Pick a low number then a high number u get ones and twos every time with a soft spin. Doesn't even make the game fun anymore 3 house 10 of each life skill. Just stupid.
Allie Ferguson,7/16/2020,"It's a fun game, but with the length of the board, it can be very short and hard to achieve goals. If you spin higher than a 5, you will mostly likely skip through the majority of a section. I have yet to buy a house and have a child in the same game. Most games I am not even able to do either."
Johnny Gonzalez,12/8/2021,"This game for what it is I would say is perfect. Simple bord game with fun twist and turns and all the nostalgia you could want. I love it, me and my wife play from time to time its great, well worth the money. Thank you to the creators very fun game."
lilladyo2cute,1/3/2021,The game freezes sometimes. I hate that i paid for an app that you have to pay to get all the boards. You should be able to unlock new worlds by completing all the puzzles in a collection. What are the collections for besides items?
Andrew Bell,11/27/2022,"For only $15 bucks, you can buy so many cool maps and all the new maps that are coming out. The only bad problem is that all the maps are the same thing, just different pictures."
Rachael Hill,2/18/2021,"Like the game but it keeps freezing up and I have to close it out and then open it again for it to work. It just happened at the end of the game and I wasn't able to see who won. A little aggravating. Other than that, I really do like the app. Its fun."
Elizabeth Gerster,2/6/2021,"It's really fun with how many options you have and I love that I get to invite friends and play in real time. My only complaint is the board seems so small, I wish the games lasted longer."
Joel Prange,7/27/2020,"I love that there is more strategy now. The first version was mindless: go to college, family route, get lucky. Now you actually have to make choices on what to persue. But (and i think im in the minority here so im fine with it) i wish games were longer, like the first version."
Andrea Frances Taylor,8/14/2022,"Better than the first GOL! I can't see the avatar or pictures to small n busy on the GOL1 app, playable but graphics and games are stressful I think ... this game has no mini games either just life decisions n spin wheel deciders ... More child friendly which suits this 47 year old just fine 🤭 enjoy"
Little Tree,3/28/2022,Ummm you're telling me I paid to get this game and it comes with one map to play on. DONT BUY THIS ITS JUST A CASH GRAB. They'll only ask you for more money so you can further enjoy the game. When in reality we should have enough to enjoy the game with just our initial purchase.
G M,7/31/2020,This is fun and charming. I like this updated version a lot. I'd give it five stars if it didn't always say 'unable to connect to the store'... I'm trying to give you my money to have an outfit for my little gamepiece and you don't even want it...
Samuel Ruiz,4/16/2022,It a great game but sometime my purchases don't apear for example I have bought the maps age of giants and lunar age some times one is playable and the other is not and it tells me that I need to repurchase the map. When I have bought both.
ron gerhart,10/21/2020,"The game has improved in stability, but it gets boring fast unless your willing to spend money to get add ons. I find that Part messed up since you have to spend money on the game then money on add ons."
Andrew Koeppel,1/20/2021,The game is ruined if one person decides not to take their turn. There's no way to communicate with other players. It's a game of pure luck no skill involved. There are no new levels it's always the same one unless you want to pay extra.
Yong hwee TAN,11/22/2021,Game play is good but it was really disappointing to know that we have to pay for additional maps and feels like it's way overprice. Even more expensive then purchasing the apps itself.
Megan Gettens,7/10/2021,"The game is amusement enough, however after paying for the game you are then expected to purchase further in app expenses. What's worst, is that I paid for the season pass to access all extra content, to play with my daughter using family library, but the extra content didn't carry over to her game and was hence an absolute waste of money."
Jordan M,2/12/2021,"I'm 36 and have never plaid Game of Life before and it's so much fun! The graphics are great and fun, and it's easy to navigate. I hope the developer makes more games. I'm loving everything they come up with."
Gary “TheGuru423” Lee,9/11/2020,Not one single complaint!!!! Thank you so much! Although I'm sure everyone will agree when I say this; We'd all be extremely gratuitous and also more inclined to purchase the other various content if you'd give us more than the basics on a new game we purchased!
zuka kog,7/25/2021,"Don't bother with the expansions, as they're just board skins but don't add any new mechanics or even flavor cards! For example, on the fantasy board, I still had the option to go to regular college and be an app developer. Why not let me go to a guild and be a wizard or something. Why have a bowling match instead of archery? Too bad we can't refund IAP's."
Jay Dautel,12/26/2020,idk if I just have the worst luck or what but the game feels really loaded in the ai's favor compared to the first one. Everytime you need the spinner for something it never gives you a chance to win. I have yet to get anything above 3rd place.
Lauryn Harper,7/31/2020,"This was a good game until today. When I tried to open the app, the only thing I see is a brown screen. I have waited for about 15 minutes to see if it's just slow, I have also made more room in my storage to make sure if it needed to update it could. It obviously does not. I have paid money for this game and would like it to work."
James Sweezy,7/15/2020,Fun spin on the game. I do wish I could skip or at least lock in the x5 button when playing against CPU players so i didn't have to spend a tremendous amount of time watching their moves.
Ashleigh Kilburn,8/30/2020,Im giving 2 stars.. 1 for the choices you can make.. i think thats cool. And 2 for the car changing as your family grows .. thsts cool.. but .. there should be a STOP .. get married for after u choose to be single for a while.. and u should still be able to stay single if u want.. why is this game sooo short.. when we paid for it.. this app should have been free.. and finally why isn't there a STOP to buy a house ? I have played this game on my smartphone and im disappointed and bord already ..
Joana Villalobos,1/15/2021,Really fun. I like this game a lot. One of the best features is that you can play with friends using just one phone (pasing it over) or the option to play online with them. Solo play available to. Great game so far.
Krys W,11/9/2020,"Booooooo! I purchased this game for what? This should have been a free game. There's nothing special about this game for it to cost. There's free games with better graphics, better game play, better every thing. But that's my bad for thinking I was going to get more out of this because I paid for it. And to add insult to injury, they provide a generic response to the other reviews about their pricing that never addresses the complaint. Don't waste your money here."
Steven Spears,1/26/2022,The spins are predetermined once you start 1 player will have abnormal high spin average while another would have abnormal low spins. I don't don't like playing rigged games.I don't care if I have the advantage or not it takes the whole fun out of the game.
Ithinkimasofa,3/31/2021,Super fun game. Upgrade to the original. Not sure any of the expansions are worth it as the core board is great. 5 bucks+ for a new board that doesn't bring enough change isn't a good value. But the main game itself is great
Rebecca Havko,11/26/2020,"You're wasting money if you buy this game. Every spin I made was terrible. Every time fate got to decide, I paid taxes. Every challenge against the ai, I lost, and they chose me for every challenge. Every time I got the slightest bit ahead in cash, I landed on taxes. I thought this would be fun and relaxing, but instead I feel angry and cheated. If you want to play life, buy the board game. At least then the computers can't cheat and you have a chance of having fun."
Caleb Perera,8/20/2021,"Multiplayer is better in the original GOL. In this one you can only invite friends and play with AI. In the original, you can invite a friend then search for other random people."
Jordan Hanger,10/15/2023,It's better then the bord game itsself I love this one is way better
iloveheltondog23,11/13/2020,"Not worth it, I knew I would only be able to play one map because I own their first game. However this map is shorter then the first game but seems longer because it is more boring then the map from their first game... don't waste your money you will get bored halfway through the first game"
GR3G J0N0,7/18/2020,"It's an entertaining game, it's not exactly making full use of its potential though. I was hoping the update would have resulted in it being a better educational tool for my teenage boys. It does a good job of making the choices availible fun and provoking some thought... But there's so much more it could do!"
Trent Rabe,7/24/2020,I would rate this higher. But with the lack of clock or timeout for players who take too long. Is unacceptable. When players take over 5 minutes to take their turn. It really makes you not want to come back.
Chelsea Cooper,7/17/2020,"It is a very fun addition to Life, the original game. There are definitely more advances with marriages, colleges, fate, and even owning two homes! Great Job! Now I wish there was a physical board game like this one!"
NATASHA S BATHGATE,8/22/2020,"Brilliant game to play for all ages. Easy to understand the importance of the game. There their's no competition, just great fun. I like the colour and the grafic."
Kayla Rudder,3/28/2022,"I love this game, my old issue I've been having is trying to play with friends we keep getting and invalid code error. I've tried with 5 different people as well as updating the game, wifi and nothing is working so pretty sad."
Emily,7/22/2020,Wonderful game I like how the changed the game and the game is very inclusive allowing purple option opposed the original pink vs blue. Also allow pets or children doesn't force you to have children. Very affordable and enjoyable. I have always enjoyed The Game of Life and will continue to.
Bobbi Sue Shaffer,9/1/2020,"Fine if ur okay only playing a second. What I mean is there are 4 players, u are 1 of 4. So for 3 rounds u r just sitting and waiting to go. U don't even move ur player the steps to the next spot on the board bc 90% of the game is all the ""computer"". When it is ur turn u press one button to ""roll the dice/draw your card"" then the computer give u an option of 2 outcomes. I.e. get married or stay single, get further education and pay raise or get a new job. You don't get to play/participate more"
Daria Lee,10/31/2021,Have to pay for the game and also pay for the other boards in game. I only got low numbers unless I was less than 5 spaces away from a STOP. I played 3 games and was last each time because I never got more than a 5. Happy it was only $1 something but definitely a waste. Don't ask for money to pay for the app if it's not even a good app.
Sebastian Simmons,7/26/2020,Great game. Fun for the family or a good time killer for yourself. Worth the purchase. Would give 5 stars if it was more polished and there was more customizable options including naming the players.
Cori C (Blessedmom89),4/25/2022,It would be nice if the game would freaking would actually work. I bough the game and one of the other map packs and the stupid game never wants to work. Dont purchase if you dont want to waste money. You've been warned.
Really Bad Channel,9/29/2021,"I contacted both google play and this games email to attempt to get my refund and both of them have refused, i sent the request literally 14 minutes after purchasing and getting into the game only to see it was VERY laggy and unplayable because of it. i got out and sent the request only to be denied multiple times."
Courtney Jarmon,10/20/2020,Not bad at all. Just wish you didn't have to pay to change board worlds/backgrounds. I wish there were more worlds that you could open after completing all of the goals in the first worlds.
Lisa Hazell,8/19/2020,The game itself is fine.. But online is awful. There is no timer so I have spent half an hour this morning waiting for someone to take their go and eventually given up. What is the point in playing when you can't finish a game.
Crystal Straub,11/20/2020,Wouldn't have bought had I know that you have to buy more in game options to have any fun with it. People often quit before you can ever finish a game. Don't recommend at all.
Derick Fox,6/7/2023,I love the game of life so i bought this game and I thought you get all the maps and costumes when you buy the game but its seperate maps that cost 12 dollors and costume packs that cost 7 to 8 each and theres at least 8 maps and 8 costume packs so its over 100 dollors or more for the full game dont buy this game its a waste of money and google play store wont refund it because it dosent meet there polices.
Clearly Wise,6/5/2022,Really thought you got more than one board to play on for the price. I get more enjoyment from free games. Don't waste your money on the graphics not worth it!
Jake Gavinlee,2/18/2022,Love the game think it's amazing to play love the themes and things that you can buy the only thing I don't like is when someone leaves the computer carrys on its a bit unfair to play against because they get everything but apart from that 100% would recommend playing me and the wife love it
Saskia Black,5/24/2023,Purchased but couldnt install. The suggestions were to quit and open googleplay again which I did but it didnt work. The next suggestion was to restart my phone but that didnt help either. As a result though theres no option of a refund anymore. So I paid for a game that I cant install. How can I get a refund?
Charles Hobbs,7/3/2022,It's a fun game but you have to spend a lot of money just to play on a different map. If you bought all the maps you be spending at least an extra 40 to 50 dollars. I think that's a little much for a paid app. I will get a refund if I could but I'm stuck with it so I'll play it when I get bored.
B V,12/9/2020,"It would be 5 stars if there wasn't anymore in game purchases. You already have to pay for the app itself... Give those who buy the app everything else free. If the game was free, then in-game purchases would make more sense. It's just dumb."
Kiana Lee,12/16/2021,Really fun game if you buy all the boards. Each board is so unique and an excellent twist on the original board game. All the fun outfits and cars you can unlock. I really love it.
Stephanie Travous,7/29/2023,I was unhappy with it. You have buy too many maps.. or outfits and it just didn't feel like a true game of life to me. I want my money back.
karthikeyan c,9/11/2020,Game crashes quite often especially in x5 speed mode. Graphics looks good. And for eg - if you roll 8 and stop location is reached in 5 spaces then the remaining 3 spaces are not counted.
Jayla Downs,1/13/2022,When I play online with my friends the game glitches and give one player multiple turns. Plus skips everyone else turns. Hopefully you guys can fix this soon other than that I love the game
Loc Nguyen,3/10/2021,It's a fresh take on a classic. I loved this game as a kid and am thrilled and thankful to play this contemporary version with my daughter. Recombining smart phones and tablets with classic and timeless games is a winning combination. Great family game!
Heather Morrison,7/29/2020,"Why do the players not start with the same amount of money? I started one game with $90k, not even enough to go to college without having to take a loan right off the bat, another game someone started with $340k!! Also the crowns should be shared if you have the same number of attributes as another player(s)"
Brittany M,1/30/2022,"I noticed this game will freeze when I fast forward while playing with the computers. When the app and come back, the game is no longer there."
Kaila Watson,1/5/2022,"Really like this game, love playing with family. The only thing I miss is the original Game of Life on the computer, where the funny sayings and cute cartoons things, now that is a version I would buy over and over again!"
DurfTheJuggaloWhoopWhoop,1/20/2023,Great fun gameplay. Love the social aspect. It's nice to communicate with other players. Had an issue but customer service was on top of it. Top notch customer service. Will definitely be checking out other games by Marmalade.
Shaf “Big Moh” Mohammed,3/11/2023,"Enjoyable and brings back memories of the board game. Time has moved on and so has the game so obviously there is a change in the game play. That said, whether you're playing solo or with friends, killing time or having fun, it's still an enjoyable experience"
john wade,7/19/2020,Great game with lovely graphics. However I've just purchased the Fairytale World to play online with my partner. We share the game via our family library but she doesn't have the new board on her screen. Surely she doesn't have to purchase the add on too??
Vanessa Dionisio,2/6/2023,Really sick and tired of this game...one..you literally have to purchase..with cash.. everything other than the original gameboard..two...it constantly glitches!!..I literally got stuck playing a game that only let me spin 1 over and over again...three...how's come I literally have a millisecond to act on my turn...but I need to sit there for 10 mins waiting for other players?..what a gyp!!!!!
Meme Davis,7/26/2022,I enjoy this game and so do my kids it's nothing like having a board game that's mess 🆓 the only thing I don't like about it is the other worlds are a bit much it's as if you're buying the same game but with a different look I'm not sure if it's worth it but the actual game in it's self is fun and nice to play with mostly all ages that can read of course
James Van cliff,5/30/2022,First time playing one of these game and i have to say i love it but the there is prices for other boards and i said how if i buy a game should have the full game but to tell the truth i have actually bought space boards and some other bits like cars and people i see myself buying all of this in small chunks as the environment are nice and each board have mission and i pkayed online such a great game im uping my 4 stars to a 5 stars im hooked to your game play every single day and night.
christopher bozowskyi,11/26/2023,Always love this game since I was little
TheGreat Bambino,11/25/2023,"Trash board is too short, bring back classic life not this pathetic excuse"
Tabitha Skogen,7/24/2023,Very good game just like the game of knife one of my favorite board games of all time and definetly can rate this game a 5 star game
Mach Multiple,7/23/2023,"Store said ""find happiness"", I looked all over and couldnt find it. Depressed."
Gavin Pearson,10/6/2023,Game won't even download. I don't even know what's wrong with the app.
Joe,1/13/2023,Can be kind of slow. Monopoly allows you to change the rules this one does not. Kind of a high price for shallow build. Also very woke which is a significant detractor from the game.
Diana Bell,8/3/2020,Game freezes constantly I have yet to play a round of just vs computer without a total freeze and restart need to pay for any type of upgrade. Not worth it
Devin Benson,9/1/2020,"The graphics are so cute and the gameplay is nice, but the jobs are repetitious. There isn't a lot of choices job wise."
daphne Picklesimer,9/12/2020,It's an okay game could look more realistic other than it being stick people gameplay could be more fun with more ways to win like mini games etc vs it being just straight shot & finished from the start
Josh Osborne,7/1/2023,Great game although it takes a while to complete it's worth it
Hannah Wethern,12/17/2020,My whole family download this and we can't play with each other. We put in the codes but nothing. We got this game to play with everyone but we can't. I also wish thier was ways to open new lands without buying. It be cool if you could win them.
Elsie Burgess,3/8/2023,Paid $3.99 for the game which was fine..my fave from childhood..did all 48 challenges for the classic pack thinking it would open the next world..but NOPE you just run out of challenges..another $4.99 PER additional level..kind of a rip off. Undownloaded..really disappointed..
Whitney Kemp,7/17/2020,"Not worth the price It has so much potential but disappointing graphics, lack of variety and a seemingly very short game board, after 2 games I'm done and want a refund. Such a let down"
Daniel White,3/6/2022,Super fun! Love the different ways to play and the animations are very high quality. Very fun way to kill time with the family!
TheUnnamed Google User,3/22/2021,"I played this for a good hour not too long after installing and I had a lot of fun. I haven't had any problems with it as some of the other reviews mentioned, but I know it's early days yet and that will probably occur in one form or another. Thus far it's very much like the original game, great graphics and a fun time."
Enya (Enya),9/10/2020,"This game constantly freezes.. very boring, limited choices, charges way too much money. I refunded as its to expensive for what it is. Play with bots you hardly play at all."
DoughBender,5/27/2021,"It was good for like 2 games. Then it becomes a boring waste of time. You roll the dice, choose between dull choices, then wait 5 minutes to do it all again. For a game that involves winning, winning a game feels more like a failure. ""Yay I got more points than these sad players."" And it you might not even be playing with real players. You play with bots(it s easy to know because the name is (adjective)(random name)(numbers). Waste of money. 1/10 A refund would be nice."
Kelsey Longabaugh,8/26/2020,Save your money. Have to purchase 2nd world for 5$ despite completing all side tasks. Redundant game play. I dont mind spending a bit of money on a fun game but I cant see how it would be worth it here.
David,7/19/2020,"This game is a giant improvement from the first, I wish however there was more of a variety to which careers you could choose, and the salaries. Also, maybe add RNG to the layout of the board."
Amanda Chin,11/9/2021,"Game freezes and/or lags here and there on occasion. It's very annoying and frustrating. Other than that, it's also very challenging to win games."
Veritas,10/3/2021,"Excellent game, only taking off 1 star for the fact everything is a micro transaction except the basic board and a few outfits. Little disappointing but otherwise the game is very fun."
MVX 11V,9/20/2020,"Just like real life... Everyone else has busy turns, making the green for what seems like no reason and I get a 2 and pay taxes. Uncanny. I finish last and end up winning at life, so there's hope yet!"
Taylen Moodley,1/7/2021,"Really great and we'll Optimized, I didn't see any ads ND the graphics are great, the colors really pop and the game is super easy to use and fun to play"
John,8/17/2020,Fun game! Just wish it was longer. Game of Life board games are known to take around 30 mins. I know a mobile game should be quick but a couple more spaces would have been nice to feel like a full game. Goes too quickly for me.
Brandon Tobin,5/16/2021,Paid dlc are you serious? 60 dollars? A couple board themes don't pass when asking that much. 10 dollars per dlc pack for a few cosmetic items on a digital board game. They're diluted. 2-5 dollars a pack =12-30 dollars for all dlc. More reasonable. Games trash for being cash grab like that.
Jan Itor,5/31/2022,One tiny board so small that if you blink you'll miss it is all you get with purchase. Rest of the game is locked away behind $30-60 of additional purchases.
Whitney Simmons,9/16/2020,"This is a really cool game. My favorite part about it, is that it has a ""pass and play"" option, where I can play with my siblings. My only complaint, is that you can't name/rename characters. So my siblings are just 2, 3, and 4, when we play."
Samantha,7/15/2020,Very well done.. engaging and different.. One thing I do enjoy is all of the options you have during the game. Graphics are very well done as well.
kristal bridges,4/22/2023,I love the game!! I have road trip and Life 2!! I would like to know if the other worlds open once you've completed all the puzzle pieces in one world!? I hope I don't have to buy them!
Shawna Hampeys,6/21/2022,"Love playing this game. Paid for the VIP and was expecting a new board in June. Have yet to see it as of June 18th. Hopefully it will show up. Running out of collectibles to get, which is the best part of the game. Thanks for the reply."
Crystal B,7/15/2020,Its a very good game I love the options it gives but I do have some suggestions Putting a spin button for easier spinning When pushing the fast forward for other players keep it on until tuened off Able to change name
Kristianna Rodgers,10/15/2021,This is not really the game of life more like the game of greed. Getting married and having kids or pets is for fun and useless. It's all about money and buying houses. You should have it like the actual game. Where kids cost so much and pets half.
Tori Lynne,3/21/2021,I LOVE the original and I love this one! The extra options are so cool and open minded. It's a really fun game and I will keep playing both 😍 I've had the original app since 2012 and just realized this version existed. I'm so happy with it so far!
Michael Sooy,6/30/2022,"Great game however, There is a few bugs like it freezing when your online. I think you should be able to get a pet and a kid but overall great game."
Cassie Dean,5/27/2021,"Love the game, although it is a bit long winded and my games keep crashing right at the end when the scores come through which is really frustrating!"
Brandon Botner,7/16/2020,"I have only played one game so far. It is beyond Beautiful. I love all the add ons and things you can do. So excited to see all the new maps they make. If they bring this game to Steam on the PC, I will be most happy and get the game for a few friends to all play together. I have high hope for this."
shawn kim,7/11/2021,It's very SLOW and Freeze A LOTS in middle of the Game. I have to restart a Whole LOT. And lost ALL my Accomplishments and my Purchase stages. I don't know if I can get my REFUNDS or NOT. This Game is Not WORTH Your money and Times. .
Christina Nunn,3/22/2022,"I love the actual game, but it quits in the middle of a game and makes me start over where I left off... this happens several times per game (2-7 times!)!!!!!!!!!!"
Blake Paterson,7/19/2020,"You would think paying $6 for a fantasy board would mean everything was fantasy, none of the action cards are changed and the college and wedding scenes aren't different. It's a shame, and I think you all should avoid buying it. It's disgraceful that Hasbro wouldn't take the time to fully change a $6 board. Lazy thieves."
Joe Overbey,10/4/2021,"Another new and updated review, over a year later: went to play the game with my wife except the online options for me are all greyed out. Can't click on them or anything. So disappointed to have spent money to be not allowed to play."
Jim Dudley,3/25/2021,Love the game. Had an account problem which re-installing didn't fix. Contacted Marmalade support. They responded quickly and fixed the issue. Great service for a great product!
Austin Bladel,9/19/2021,My wife and I use this to pass time in many ways. We get a kick out of playing the traditional life games anywhere we are. We have waited in long lines and played this game because it's so easy to use and fun. There's so many choices to pick from. I don't normally write reviews but when this one popped up asking me to write one I decided it was worth it. You definitely won't be bored with this game
Angela Lang,10/6/2021,I think this game is double fudge store because me and my granddaughter every single Disney playlist day in the car because it's really fun to play and I think it makes us spend more time together so this is why it doesn't fire strong on and also I get to play all the weather book and so my family so he's gone so like it's really good
Jessica Nottingham,11/21/2020,"It was okay. For $3.99, I expected there to be a lot more things you can do. I was disappointed that the other boards in the game were another $3.99 each. Also, game kept freezing pretty bad."
Falling Starz,11/6/2021,"Love all the different board game options, also the different play options, i like that i can play with different users besides bots and the character outfits are pretty cheap."
SaraRae Webb,9/16/2020,The only thing that would make this better is to be able to invite friends to a room and also be able to add bots or random online players. You can do any of the 3 but not at the same time.
Lindsey Brodie,7/11/2021,"Game is ok. Purchased season pass thinking that if I host the game all members in it would see the new maps I selected, but this was not the case. Therefore wouldn't recommend buying the extra maps, not worth the money."
Reid F,2/1/2022,"Game is remarkably glitchy when in the 5X speed mode, extra maps shouldn't be behind the pay wall. Maps, collectibles, etc. should be your incentive to keep playing."
pit fiddelaers,2/6/2022,"I'm in the middle of a game with friends and the app just crashes. no way possible to join the game again.. the game overall is underdeveloped, and not worth the money in this state unfortunately"
Kevin Dlst,8/11/2020,"i thought i bought a full game, there's more 'Worlds' or simply maps to unlock; the only way to unlock is to buy again. not to mention there's this Seasonal Pass which is like what the heck i just bought for? for more buys? your trailers not telling me that there's still more buys inside the game, all i know i just bought a game and it's not full. what a shame, i wanna refund"
Mason Bull,12/21/2022,"Fun game to play when feeling board on a long drive, train, airplane etc. However, the game may be annoying depending on how big your screen Is."
Emma turbo,11/20/2020,I wish there was a longer game option like a lot longer. Like for 4 bucks it seems like way overpriced like it almost seems like a trial version like the short version you don't have to pay for. I'm okay that there is in game purchases put like this game was way too short.
Terrence Huebner,5/7/2022,"My kid payed $3 dollars for this game to play with his friends but the ""online"" and ""play with friends"" option is greyed out. Emailing the developers bounces back an email saying that the ""contact us"" email doesn't exist....... So far, very disappointed. No stars"
DrunkPauloCosta,9/28/2021,Screw everyone who gave this a good review. Its literally basic and shorter than the other one and instead of making longer versions of the game for 2 players ect its just basically game of life but somehow less fun than number 1. Like what the hell how this got to be an official squel upsets me and i wasted 7 bucks.
Josh Harwood,3/28/2021,"Summary: you pay for the game and then also have to pay for everything inside the game. You can't unlock levels as you go, you have to buy them! And they cost more than the original game!"
Ozzie,4/21/2021,"... I like it I really like it alot but after playing a few matches it gets boring and you cant even unlock with maps! you haft to buy them, if you were let's say a 5 year old kid and your parent bought you this game you can only play on one map without asking your parents to waste more money"
Mario De La Cruz,1/4/2021,It's a great experience very simple but fun. Only bad thing is it's not a total game. And there are world's to purchase and not for a reasonable price.
Felix Koh,12/22/2022,"This game logic is not so real but it definitely cured my bored now this game is my favorite game but the only thing I don't like is I already bought the game but in the game u need to buy more like map, outfits, cars, but good game if you are seeing this comment definitely try this games"
Grampy Roma,6/25/2021,I was excited to play this game online but once I pressed search I waited a long long while and it still didn't find anyone for me to play with. You also only get 1 map. In app purchases for the rest of the maps.
Tracy Gibson,10/13/2022,"Best game ever! It works so well, it's never glitched for me AT ALL!!! it works so smoothly and I play for hours! I'm not very good at the game but it somehow managed to still be so fun! Best money I have ever spent. BUY ITTTTTT!!!!"
Daniel Shafer,7/18/2020,"Game is fun with family multi-player and thankfully supports family library but 5.99 for the other board, for my entire family that's 18 dollars for all 3 of us. Really disappointed the company got greedy. You'd get more people buying cheaper boards than this high price which probably won't make as much money."
Tony Foster,12/14/2020,"Love this game but am going to say the same as I did for the monopoly game I have as well you pay for both games excepting to be able to progress onto different boards but no £4.99 please you do make me laugh at least make it so that some boards are free, oh no we can't do that. JOKE springs to mind"
P. Neato,8/19/2022,"I love this game, but it's telling me to update before I can join my daughter's lobby game, I type in the code and it says I must update to the latest version of this game, but there's NO update button anywhere in the app or play store... So we are completely stumped & now we can't play together😩"
shelley Dalton,9/4/2020,"I dropped my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars for freezing in middle of game play problem.This game is fun and I play every chance I get but it keeps freezing up and I have to get completely out of the game,really love this game and as soon as the freezing problem is fixed I will give it 5 stars again"
Dehnck,9/4/2020,"The Game of Life has always been my favorite board game to play with others, this online remaster, having the options of solo, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer, it gives me all-the-more reason to share this love with others!"
CJ Amused,12/2/2020,It's bit boring in single player waiting on the ai turns. It'd be nice to have more interactive options during that time.
Emily Brentley,9/1/2021,"The boards are way too short. I don't know if this is an issue with the classic GOL version, but the games are so short it's infuriating."
c d (Seek890),8/1/2020,"Consistent crashing, comes with one map after you pay for the game and then they expect you to pay the same price for an additional map? Not worth the money."
Josh Veach,2/20/2022,"The game is fun. It's especially fun to play with someone else. I got obsessed for awhile collecting all the portraits and such, but once I got them there wasn't much reason to play solo."
Amy Johnson,12/19/2020,I would rate 5 stars all the way across if the different worlds were shareable like the app itself. It's no fun to only have one person see the new world. I downloaded Frozen Lands so we could all play it.
Heru Khuti,12/1/2020,"Coming up as a kid this was one of my favorite board games, use to play it on the board, my playstation or computer it did'nt matter lol,so it's always good to tap back in bringing back the good ole memories lol I always loved this game."
pshelbs23,2/3/2021,Worked perfectly at first. After a couple of games the app kept bugging and freezing mid game after someone's turn. Absolutely broken.
Cra2yOne,7/25/2020,I like this game but my girl is on the family share and she decided to get the season pass thinking if we bought the app and shared why not the season pass also...nope so we would have to pay 30 dollars for each account to play new stuff. Fix to share with family plz
Anthony Felix,11/2/2020,"Fun, short game thats perfect for mobile with plenty of customization. As a bonus the devs are great at responding to issues and very helpful."
Samantha Bilancetti,8/26/2020,One of the best board games on the market extremely fun love playing with my family great job to everyone that put their time and effort in making this amazing board game. I really hope there are more maps in the future because this game has the potential to be the greatest board game ever.
David Higgs,11/1/2020,"Great game, I love playing it. The controls are easy, the gane runs really smooth. I think its a great 2nd game of life."
Tony Mackin (Mackin1219),7/31/2020,"They charge you more than the first game of life just to give you like 4 different t action cards. Not many options at all. Then the only different variant, you have to pay more money for."
Christopher Petitto,1/9/2021,Absolutely love it. Definitely like playing solo or with others. Definitely should make more worlds and have others being cheaper. Need improved but worth it a bit.
Carrie Culbertson,4/4/2022,"We love this game! Its colorful, fast paced, competitive and not a long game. We had to kill 20 minutes waiting to get into a restaurant, and it flew by while playing Life!"
Mienshao620,12/19/2020,"Disgusting taking my money and unable to play the game. I am connected to the wifi, it says I have none. I only got to play one single player game and now won't load another single player game are you serious??? Like how am I suppose to play a game I paid for I thought it would be better because I spent money in fact it's worse. I want a refund"
Zoe,2/24/2022,"This cannot possibly be considered a game. There is nothing here. Playing one game, you see every card and every option. I thought this would be a nice relaxing way to play a board game before bed with my partner. I can't believe we wasted money on this."
Shian Boatwright,1/24/2021,Its okay on some places. So u have to buy every world. 3.99 each 3 of them buy all the avatars and caracters and cars buy all 3 bundles 3.99 each only includes 3 characters 1 avatars 1 car u have to buy 1 for each world so another 3.99 3 times so thats already 3.99 7 times bc 1 for the game and the others to unlock everything can i pease get the 3.99 3 times back i wish i could unbuy all 3 worlds i bought and a refund for the game as well.. Very disapointed. Refund for worlds and game please...
Dani,7/4/2021,"My family and I loved this game prior to the 6/21 update, and as far as I know at this point my Samsung Note 9 is the only Samsung in the house having issues, but it will no longer open the game. Have tried reinstalling, all the google suggestion and more to no avail. Any suggestions from the app maker because OTHERWISE im changing my 5 STARS TO A 1 STAR RATING."
Bridget P,12/10/2021,I'd definitely like it alot more if I didn't have to buy everything 🙃 you should be able to collect points to unlock the boards instead of paying for them.
DeAnne Mae,1/1/2021,The cost is for one board. You have to pay for different boards. And its kinda buggy. It lags a little. Just not what i expected from a $5 game
Thomas Gagne,4/2/2022,"Same board game I love, but on the go. Has buyable game boards to change the game entirely. Has play and pass. So you can play with family and friends on one device."
Trisha,7/11/2022,Fun game but being that it was a purchased game there should be multiple boards you can choose from not charge additionally to try a new one . Kind of makes the game slightly less fun
Tara Jacek,11/29/2020,"Fun but too glitchy. For a game you have to pay for, it's really annoying when you don't even get credit for playing because the game freezes."
Fritzy-Kitty 1,10/28/2022,"Game is very well thought out. I usually play with the sound muted but I love the music, and sound effects. Graphics are adorable."
ChickenBoy78,7/22/2020,Amazing app. You can tell that a lot of time went into it. My only problem is that sometimes it lags but that is to be expected from a high quality game like this. I hope the developers keep making amazing games like this.
Melissa Childress,7/7/2022,I don't think that it's fair to charge for the base game and not include the extras. It's a pretty expensive game once you've added in the other themes
Toki Totoro,9/18/2020,please fix the glitches. i have to reset the game sometimes. great game but a little short. needs an expansion.
Mark A (dancingdodo27),9/15/2020,They've removed the mini games which is partly why I loved the first one. And now They've added too many different features which kinda dilutes the content. The original is far better
kyle,7/6/2022,"Total cash grab. One small board to play on, everything else is pay to play. They are basically selling what would normally be the free version of most games."
Bryn pls,7/31/2020,how about adding the ability to add bots to a game? it makes it a little silly when there are three trophies to get when 2 players are fighting for 3 trophies. that are worth 400 points
joy daron,8/11/2020,"Cute, simple and perky... Not too expensive, but tempting to buy some things. Not sure yet what can be earned and what must be purchased. Time will tell."
Lady Noodlegoo,8/5/2020,"Sucked, why is there no time limit on waiting for other players. Just silly that none gets to play cause you have to continue to wait. I wanted to see how long it would take after 15mins I quit. Really would like a refund on my purchase."
Darlok Williams,7/21/2020,Very slow gameplay and several other issues. It's like Netflix made this adaptation of the classic board game.
Eric Snare,8/8/2020,"I went to play the game, paid for it, loades it, then I go to start it and it automatically kicks me out before any screen for the game comes on. Please look into this"
Ryu Chan,9/25/2021,"I recommend not to buy anything inside this game because every items you buy in this game will not be transferred into new device you switched, account is not binded to anything (Google play service,Facebook,Line) and this game don't save all your progress if you restart phone or anything"
Karnell,1/4/2023,"Very different game as always. I loved this game as a kid and teenager. Would like to see better animation, it's still 2D-ish at times. I hope I'm making sense."
Hilary Harris,10/23/2020,I love the game and can't wait to see future worlds. However when playing the puzzle pieces for expanding your family are not activating no matter how many kids or pets i have.
Ipendeep Singh,7/17/2020,It's a fun game that brings back the nostalgia of playing on an actual board. If theres one thing that could be added it would be a Turn Timer.
Fallen Destroyed,4/15/2022,There should be a way I can link with my nintendo account. Or make it so you can sign in multple accounts on nintendo switch. I bought this game on mobile so my wife and I can play together while being able to earn my own unlocks just to find that I have no access to the bundles I purchased on another platform
Annamaria Saska,7/15/2020,The games is fun and intetactive but 2 out of 3 times the game got stuck on one of the choices and that was the end of it. Very dissapointing
Em Ray,2/21/2022,Its fine. Not worth the 5$. Each expansion is 5$ also. Nothing makes this different or better than other version. (I do enjoy that it goes beyond the gender binary however).
Kirsten James,8/12/2020,"Good game, I wish the board was a little longer and also, there is no way to be able to pay back your loan. Everytime I try, it doesnt work and the jint thing doesnt tell you how. I tried clicking on the loan and nothing happens."
Sean Spofford,9/14/2020,My daughter and I love the game. We purchased the season pass. We have just two questions. Is the season pass for life and when can we expect more world's? Thanks
Uasakura,11/4/2021,"Its an okay game, I wanted to play with real people, but i highly doubt the online mode are real people, they all seems like bot to me. Their name appears to be fake, and their reaction time are instant just like ai, tried online about 4 times, they spin and make decisions without even a second of reading...."
Sage Stringos,1/2/2023,It would be five stars but I'm disappointed that you don't receive points for having children and animals and how many action cards you get. The first game is better because of that. You should add those features.
Cheryl L,8/19/2020,Very boring game as it's pretty much the same outcome no matter which option you choose so there's nothing special about this game! I totally regret ever paying for this one as it definitely was not worth it!
Dory Zaouk,10/4/2020,Fun game with an improvement to the old classic. And an option to fast forward players' moves. I really enjoyed it.
Jared Dinaburg,12/10/2020,It's a great and fun game. I enjoy playing it with my wife. My only huge complaint is that my wife and I bout the bundle for fairytale kingdom and now it's gone and I paid money to have that board. My wife has Apple and she bought the same board bundle and has it. I have Android and it's gone. My wife tries to invite my to play fairytale kingdom and when I enter the code to play it says invalid code. Also it says I owned fairytale kingdom and I can't get it again. I'm extremely not pleased
Dre McCoy,2/26/2023,"Love it so far me and my immediate family play every lol. No problems at all. No ad problems, payment problems, free to play!! Might as well but it today!"
Michael Sior,2/2/2023,It looks like there was an update that added more souvenirs and picture locations. However I never seem to get them. Is this intentional? Like another vacation location is coming?
Ruben Van Der Linde,8/14/2022,"This game is pure trash. The gameplay is really bad, it's boring, it's short and repetetive. You PAY for the game. You PAY for 1 short and boring level, that is all you get. Then they want you to PAY even more for the rest of this bad game. The devs told me ""oh but you can buy skins"", so what? What will skins do? Skins won't change the gameplay. The devs that made this horrible game is like EA, you pay for a bad game and then they want you to pay even more for the rest of it."
Malcom Vail,7/15/2020,"I have only played the single player so far, but I really love how its more of a video game than the first one, you have so many more options, ready for the extra maps and accessories"
Melvin May,6/4/2023,"Haven't played yet but I have seen a YouTuber play it, It's really nice and like the board game it's just it takes several tries for me to download it so unless you can handle that like me.... Don't waste your money"
Markus Johnson,10/4/2020,Honestly a waste of 3 bucks like the game itself is fine but its boring online pvp takes a long time its very bland after playing a few times and it seems like theres like no stragety to it all you do is spin and puck between 2 options very repetitive
Justin Dillman,3/20/2021,Very very repetitive unless you want to spend more money on add ons. Paying only gets you the base game and it's very short and no replay value
Kenny Rain,2/10/2023,Once I bought it. Noticed I can only play one map without having to also purchase each map individually. I dont recommend buying the full version
Rinn Tischler,7/24/2020,"I love it. It fun and easy, and new game play impressive make me super excited to see future world to come. Great little game to play with my nephew too. Such a great purchase."
Karen B,9/15/2020,I'm not sure why this is not cheaper with it freezing all the time. I'd give it 5 if you can fix the freezing. I've only been playing for 1 hr
mbaker81,4/17/2021,"I enjoy the game but when I first installed it, I got the package where I had access to the full board and future options but when I went into the app to play the game it is making me have to pay again to have access to something I already previously paid for."
Michael Mazierski,8/30/2022,This game would be fun if... Game didn't crash every 8 minutes. Restarted it again and then it crashed again 8 minutes in. Cool
Dalton McBurney,7/19/2020,Great game but can never finish a game because it allways over heats my phone ( Samsung s7) this is the only game that I've had do that so hopefully u guys can figure something out to prevent it from overheating would be great.
Blake Hovermale,8/19/2020,"I would give it a 5 star, but the game locks up every once in awhile making me have to stop the app and load again. Overall good game, would be great if that was fixed"
Tiffani West,7/31/2021,Was a great game even purchased an extra map to play. Got away from it for close to week and now I can't play the map! Not cool!!! Lived it until that happened!
Hawke Lane,8/5/2020,"The game is cute, but despite having an option for sound on, its silent. I checked to make sure it wasnt a settings issue on my end."
Gillian Ford,3/15/2021,"I love this game. One of my all time favourite games, perfect for all the family to get up and play. I can't wait to see when the game of life 2 comes out on the Nintendo switch."
D C,12/11/2022,"*COULD BE 5 STARS WITH ASSISTANCE* It will only let me download my game to one device, and let it have all the maps i mean, I bought the lifetime maps bundle, and can't get the maps to be purchased on my tablet."
C Singleton,10/14/2020,AI wins more than human players & it's not concise. Game tells you to pay loans before the end of the game but there's no selectable option to do so. Starting to hate I paid for this.
Syahid Hafizi,1/29/2021,"Decided to play because of Ohmwrecker. Now, i do love the concept of the game. I guess, somehow it does let us learn what path we decide. Good Game though. Thumbs up to the developers 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
Kyle Kinderman,12/10/2020,"Game disappeared from apps Not sure what happened, but after the update, the game disappeared from my apps. Have to go through the play store if I want to play it."
Kelli Carruthers,2/6/2022,"Great little game! Fun for all ages. As good as the board game, with the exception of having globally friends! Ty for this little game in such a negative time in our lives."
Gary Campbell,8/6/2020,"So far so good!! Pretty great little game, Lots of different options with the same feel as the original. Worth the download, Vams can get expensive with all the extra Add Ons"
Justin Stroud,4/18/2022,"Freezes on computers turn, playing with spouse it froze in her turn and kicked her out. The computer took over her rounds. This is persistent."
Sirchucky247,7/16/2020,Very cute was worried about lag however game ran very smoothly on LTE connection! Great time killer hoping that I can slowly unlock cosmetics for car/player with the puzzle pieces I earn! Overall great game
Lourdes Nelson,10/22/2021,The graphics are great but the game doesn't play fair. The robot always wins and always gets the best options.
Valessie McAneny,2/16/2022,"So the game is good and I like that, but I'm extremely annoyed that I've paid £6 to unlock the haunted Hills map and skins but when I play with friends or for others in my Google play family, it does not allow them to also see the map. Even when I host the game I expect the friends I'm playing with, or even those who yet again are on my family library, to be able to see the map. I'm not expecting them to be able to use the skins they've not paid for, but at least be able to see the map."
Ariez Vixxen,8/19/2020,Really fun colorful game with pretty graphics and smooth controls. It's just as fun as the board game use to be for me. A well deserved 5 stars
Jake,3/25/2021,I absolutely love the game but now it seems I'm not getting my puzzle pieces when I grow my family. All I need is three left to open up the next land and for some reason I don't receive my pieces like I'm supposed to?! I've grown my family at least 5 times and have received NOTHING.
Connor Bunstine,9/14/2020,"Very fun game, especially with online multi-player. Great graphics, good choices. Overall an enjoyable experience."
Melissa Martin,7/16/2022,Once you purchase the game it shouldn't cost you to go to other boards. I like the game but it gets boring after playing the same board over and over and over again.
Benjamin Yitzsroel Goldman,2/7/2021,"This game is so great and amazing But, the DLC is 4 times more expensive rather than in the pc(I check in Steam website). Altough the discount in the mobile is 73% and 54% while in the pc maximum discount 30% and 15% with the same quality services and amount products, which is technically it should be more expensive in the pc rather than in the mobile because the discount is less. In the mobile it cost $42 with the 73% discount while in the pc it's only cost $12 with the 30% discount."
Dodo Mt,12/27/2020,Works pretty well. I've played a few matches of pass and play with my little brother and we had a blast. It's not the best game in the play store but it's a solid board game with a great execution.
Stephen V,12/23/2020,Fun game but is is too short of a game Also if another player goes afk there is no timer or eject player option so you are stuck waiting or have to leave the game. I also wish there was a chat option.
Jason Stayton,5/29/2021,"Absolutely love this game. Totally worth the purchase. Only callout would have to be, i wish you could skip players a bit faster."
Todd Paeper,12/18/2020,Fun game but it freezes a lot. About every other game is affected. This is the only Marmalade game I've played that freezes up like this.
mandy whitaker,2/9/2021,"Fantastic, easy friendly game, fantastic graphics, play solo, with friends or against the game. Highly recommended for an easy no fuss game"
V Crowley,1/11/2023,very AI favored... the amount of low numbers you land on are ridiculous and repetitive.. and AI is slow ... this could have been a good game... just boring and waste of money
Andréy P.,10/17/2022,"Enjoying this game with my family. But the problem is when I login to bubble, I cannot change the name of other player in pass & play. Please fix it."
Justin Bullard,12/5/2022,Really fun easy gameplay loved all the different options within the game love the Simplicity of the game and I like that the graphics were all up inside of the city or town
Rebecca S,5/23/2022,Very fun and interesting! I love how you can customize your character and how this game has so many different and exciting features to it! The Game of LIFE is my favorite board game!
Patrick Silva,4/21/2023,"I cant install this app.. deleted the play store, download manager and play services cache data, uninstall updates, reset the device, used wifi or mobile data, cleared apps to have 5gb of available data Nothing works, and i cant refund it, so i cant use an app i bought"
Camo Hunter,1/8/2021,"Fun but sometimes this game crash or broken. When computer(CPU) spin, this game start stuck or crash in a single player. Please Fix! I give 1 star because this game crash and cannot refund."
Mike MC,11/30/2021,"WHY IS THERE NO TIMER FOR ONLINE? Seriously. Can't finish an online multiayer game when the opponents just sit idle doing nothing for 30 minutes. Useless, YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO ALLOW PEOPLE NO TIME LIMITS"
Dylan Yeager,4/21/2022,"Keeps freezing on ""Waiting for 'computer player name'"" Won't let me pause to save and quit either. My app is fully updated."
Katherine Churma,9/3/2020,Loving this game!! Just purchased Season Pass. Was wondering when the new worlds will be released? Please and thank you. Life was and is always my favorite board game. Love having it on an app!!
Astr0 Bear,7/9/2022,It's so fun and you can play with friends and family online or pass it around and also use smart view on a TV to stream it for everyone to see the game! Well worth it
Ghanja Lounge,10/28/2020,"My rating would be 5 stars, but there's no way to chat to other players when you're playing online. Also no emotes or taunts, that would make it a bit more interesting."
Amanda Brant,11/12/2022,"Simple, but fun! Good game to pull out and knock out a round or two while chilling with a friend, playing with family, or just passing time."
Louis Poh (IntricationZ),8/18/2020,"There's no saved progress in terms of collectibles when you continue to play the game on another device. I'm not sure if I bought anything on the in-game store, it would allow me to restore purchases on another device because I don't see any option for that. Maybe a developer can clarify here for me?"
Danielle Maieritsch,12/23/2022,"It's really good, and it's a very fair price! You can customize your character, get married! Lol. Not one thing a would change!"
Kieran Miller,11/16/2021,Played a small amount so far and in loving it. I've had some bad experiences with games based on tabletop games but this does not fall into that category. Completely recommend
Brandy Crise,10/21/2021,"Not the game experience I remember. It's short, crazy expensive paywall, missing important game mechanics, and over simplified."
Tom,7/16/2020,"I purchased this game, why do I have to purchase cosmetics and maps as well? Complete rip off. Just increase the base price of the game and give us everything."
hotsilverangelyue,12/25/2021,Good game to pass around with friends and family. Though slightly repetitive and online is basically abandoned.
Eline,1/23/2023,"Great game, but I lost all my progress when I got a new phone. It remembered that I bought some of the bundles, but not the progress of them. I have to start over with all of them."
Chrystal Christie,8/29/2021,I honestly wish this was an actual board game its so much fun. There are a few issues with it crashing every now and again but other than that its great
Alrie Alves,4/22/2022,"Bought this game just so that I can play with friends, but it has hung every single game ive tried to play against a friend. A waste of money. Disappointed."
Emily Shank,7/22/2020,"This is amazing game! I recommend getting it. The developers spend alot of time creating it and its delightful. Also, there will be new worlds aswell."
Stephen Briggs,8/24/2020,Game keeps freezing in the middle of the game as the npc's in single player can't decide what to do. Refunding the game.
Tigger Mackie,8/18/2020,Hi yes I like the game but for about 2 weeks now when me and my brother try and play it together we have a very hard time to get on and even play a full game without one of us getting kicked out plzzzz fix this thanks
hazel Bowen,5/12/2022,It is a great game and stays true to the original board game. Only thing is it is no longer letting me play online anymore. I can't figure out why either. It won't let me put in my game name either.
Angie Parsley,1/8/2021,Decent basic life game. Now if this was free I would be willing to fork out $6+ on a bundle but since I already payed for the game I won't be buying more into it.
Lilly Persicke,8/18/2021,Awesome game way more fun playing on my phone than playing with a board. Works great. Doesnt take a long time to load without high speed data.
Firman Hidayat,3/29/2023,"i played online several times, now i cant play it anymore bcz it said no connection! an internet connection is required to play online. My internet work well :( edit : Thanks alot it work well again after i reinstalled it"
Anvi Bajaj,2/19/2021,"I enjoyed playing this game but now it keeps kicking me out , I tried reloading and still same issue , please help . It keeps kicking me out of game every time I try to play."
Hayden Starr,9/1/2021,"I guess the game of life was always a short play, but a longer map or something would be nice. As the game is now gets boring fast."
Brandon Buckley,10/10/2020,"So I came back to rate the game again. I got a new phone because it was time, so I install only to find all my progress is gone.. haha. Good luck with that style.."
Rebecca Forbes,7/17/2020,"I wrote a review yesterday, but I forgot to add this one suggestion which would make this game even better: I think that there should be ethnic hair choices, rather than just ""White people hair"" to be more inclusive."
Joe Schmoe,8/15/2022,"Extremely basic. Graphics for a toddler, but gameplay intended for a teenager. Opposite of fun, and already uninstalled."
Deb L,6/25/2021,"Works great, until it doesn't. The game is fun, but it freezes when I receive notifications via any other app."
Tina Ready,7/20/2020,"I remember playing this game as a child and I loved it, so to be able to play this game now is great. The graphics are awesome, and I like the different options you have on how you can play definitely recommend this game!!"
Caiden Gaming,3/8/2023,"Game is really great and I saw your reply. I can't get the game anymore, (not enough money) although it would be great if it went on a sale or something. I'm so close to getting a lot of play points"
Caesar Porman,7/11/2021,great game for 15 min of fun. other platform cost 10x more. so if just want to have a quick fun buy a 1 or 2 5$ maps. should be more than enough to entertain u and fam
Shelly F.,12/4/2020,I am enjoying this second adaptation of The Game of Life!! Much more fun than the first. Better than the Vacations one. Overall much better!
Matthew Munson,10/2/2020,"This is game is very addicting. My friend and I play everyday for hours on end. However, we have been anticipating new worlds and so far none has come out. When will new worlds arrive?"
Glibby,3/29/2023,I swear I spend more time in the transition screens than I do playing the game. Let me skip all the unnecessary stuff and play the game.
Zachary Rongo,1/9/2021,"The animations are great, but the game is a bit buggy. On a rare occasion, the game will just get stuck."
Traci Kintner,3/5/2023,"BORING! I can't believe I paid $1.99 after using a $2 credit. I was questioning my purchase after 10 min. After 30 min., I was done"
Christi Davis,5/14/2021,Love this game on any platform. I wish the pass to play game was a little more involved and not as short. Overall my daughters and I enjoy playing.
ItsOnePixel,1/16/2021,"Perfect game! Saw Jdlly, Slogo and Crainer play it, and I instantly wanted to buy it. The game is a great experience, alone or with friends and family."
Marianne V,11/9/2021,"Had to change from android to iPhone for medical video sessions only available on FaceTime. Google can I have refund on game pass and all games purchased under android phone, and now I’m medical required to have iPhone for FaceTime to up keep my many Dr appts. Marianne Vinas, a customer for years!"
Sarah Rabel,7/27/2021,It is one of my favorite old board games. Was hoping the collectables would unlock more. It wasn't what i expected.
Shayla Namauu,9/2/2021,Had to factory reset my phone. I lost everything I had gotten from collecting the puzzle pieces. No way to get them back that I'm aware of. :(
Izel Barzilay,9/24/2021,I bought the game but online multiplayer and online with friends options are non existent. I see the buttons but it can not be clicked. How can I solve this?
Traveller,1/17/2023,"Was hoping to take advantage of the 50% off the VIP pass, that was valid for 10 more days - but it's since dropped off and gone back to fill price. Oh well...."
Shelly Teeter,7/26/2022,Best game ever made...love the graphics and the characters..always time to enjoy the classics..keep up the great work.
Ben Campbell,12/31/2020,"Play with friends' option simply doesn't work. Repeated 'Invalid Code' errors. Considering that was the sole reason for purchasing, this can only get 1 star."
Lamar Taylor,1/14/2021,"Computer cheats too much to enjoy a game. Computer always gets the better job, higher rolls, and always has more money. Had to delete"
Liva Eistere,10/18/2020,Its much better than the first part but i dont like the outfits in the game for girls . But just changing the hair color and outfit color would already do a lot!
The Rap Game,7/29/2021,I need a better phone my s7 has trouble keeping up with the animations at times. Still a good game but the dlcs are still not worth it.
Shannon Huskinson,5/11/2021,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. This game is absolutely rubbish. All it does is crash, stops working and just doesn't even work correctly. Just wish I could get my money back on it its that awful. Do not bother wasting any money on this."
Fredrick Snett,7/21/2020,The game of life is one of my favorites as a kid. I haven't played it since I was about 7. No one plays board games in real life anymore. I can finally play it again since this game is all around the world(online game)! Thank you!
Loree Wiedeman,4/30/2023,"Fun game, but I paid for sweet room, and didn't get any of the items included with the bundle... 5 dollars for NOTHING!!! Very disappointed..."
Brietta Farmer,7/17/2020,The new animations are fun and the game play is still pretty simple definitely a great time killer.
Tiffany Trotter,8/22/2020,"I got the game and I can say I really love it. I have loved playing life since I was a kid, but the real life game is just so slow. This takes away this hassle and has great graphics. I'm glad I got it. :)"
The Majik Manifesto,11/17/2021,"I really like this game! Cute, fun, interactive and entertaining. Thank you to the developers for bringing one of my childhood favorites to LIFE! (no pun intended) 😁"
Annika Chambers,1/17/2021,"It's a fun game, but you'd think for paying $4 it wouldn't glitch every 5 minutes and have to restart the game."
Tia Leanne,10/19/2020,"Absolutely love this Game. I took a Star off for the fact that we're using Peg Characters like the Board Game, and not Animated Characters like the Classic PC Game."
kandi kane,2/13/2021,It freezes up constantly and then kicks you out the game. Ive only had for a hour and i have been kicked off twice. Money wasted smh.
Amanda Hicks,5/20/2021,My 8 year old daughter loves playing this game together but I find it a little boring after a could of games. I wish there different boards not just the one...
Cloud Leach,3/5/2021,"Amazing, I play it everyday with my wife. I bought the full version and would do it again for how much fun we've really had, it's ridiculous."
Ryan Peck,10/10/2020,"Single player game is not very interesting, is it's mostly just chance. The look is wonderful, but not fun enough for me to want to play again."
DatDuelist,4/19/2021,Love the game! Sad thing that the expansions are just overly priced cosmetics. I have to say that the fantasy set rocks though. Love it
Kelly Schachter,7/22/2022,The game is super fun! I would definitely give it 5 stars if the action cards were also themed for each of the alternate boards.
Casper Mendez,10/11/2020,Its just the way i expected to be. This is exactly how game of life used to be just with a few fun little upgrades. I really enjoy this game and can only recommend it
Dee Dra,10/16/2020,I like this game and all but the only question I have is how in the world do you repay loans back before you retire??? Will put 5 stars if my question gets aswered thanks Edit: thank you for getting back to me! That was driving me crazy trying to figure it out!!
Donna Kaplan,11/27/2020,"I ""played"" one game. A few of my stable apps went haywire. The banners and awards are annoying. I prefer the older App."
KiroPezza,3/19/2022,"Great. Have to turn music and sfx to make it work without lag but other than that, great game."
Stirling Hall,2/10/2022,This is a great game of life and unlike other games this game actually comes with a challenge and I haven't had 1 app pop up yet. Great game 10 out of 10!
Mikah Maiden,4/11/2023,This is supprr fun and has no adds to get in the way also it lets you pick if you want to be offline or online soparents dont have to be worried about that. FUNNEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jaicee Meier,5/11/2022,"It keeps on glitching up. It's to the point where I can't even hardly play it. I can't even play it for more then 3 min. And I have to turn it off I even paid for all of the worlds so I spent a lot of my money just to play a stupid game that I can't even play now because of the glitching. What am I supposed to do? I hope I can at least get my money back, if I'm unable to play it."
Chris Bender,11/1/2021,The game favors the computer so highly It makes it not fun I can only spin 1-4 unless it's my oppents lucky number then at the end since I'm only at Carrer and there retired theye win everything never buying from marmalade again its sad it's more important that the computer has the advantage then letting the game play out naturally
Magic 10 Slots,7/15/2020,When I got to the end the game would not work fully connected to internet I switched to 4g it worked for 2 second then could not do anything so had to close game so know idear if I won also there is no way to see past games
Garrett Ratt,10/22/2021,"Paid 7.50 for the game, wanted to get a different map so paid another 7.50 for the spooky pack and its literally the same map just reskinned. The game is all chance there no skill involved what so ever."
Randal Alford,1/14/2021,"Fun game but goes thru bouts of NO INTERNET CONNECTION when I try to play multi-player mode, yet I'm connected to the internet. Rather frustrating."
Zoe Kendzierski,1/25/2021,I love this game me and my mom play it all the time it is so fun. I like that you get to design your character and play with your friends I love that you can do everything you can do on the bored game. This game is awesome👍
Kisharn Kumara Vell,7/26/2022,For some reason i cant change my name and online multiplayer and play with friends is locked. Its really boring playing with only bots.FIX THIS OR GIVE ME A REFUND!!!
Janette Lindsey,9/17/2020,Far from the classic Was super excited to play however there is so much change we didnt get to buy a home or have a good chance for a family Hopefully you fix it??
Emma Hood,10/9/2021,Enjoy playing this game but seeing as we pay for this game why ask for us to pay more to play different worlds. Abit cheeky to be honest. Why can't we unlock worlds/outfits by completing collections.
Tyson Walz,4/6/2023,34 years old loved the game of life since I was very young. The game was well worth the price and run great and has amazing replayability
Ashlee Hanford,8/12/2021,"MEH....$4 for a game with no advancement or rewards except an extra outfit or so, was fun til it got boring unless you're willing to pay $4 for a different board everytime"
Poppy B,4/17/2023,its good mostly BUT the board is a lot shorter and a whole bunch of stuff is paid (theres a whole vip package you can pay for) i think i prefer the first game.
Kristian Townsend,12/6/2020,"Super fun!! I was playing my first competitive game and won by a few points, overall performance is very good so far but would like a bigger map"
Kristy Langellier,4/27/2021,I love this game. It works perfectly in single player and is really fun. You can choose how many AI are in your game too.
Alexis Edwards,12/2/2021,"This is terrible, the only way to unlock other boards is to pay $4.99... once you collect everything you have no point to play on..."
Jordan Martin,8/12/2020,"Great game, love all the choices and new aspects. Also love that you can play with your friends online."
Amanda Utley,3/15/2021,The whole family loves it. We have 2 different board games of LIFE & I just Absolutely in love with this one I downloaded on my phone. My husband even dowloaded it!!
Heather Nelson,4/11/2022,This game is just ok. I would play this game more if you added points for the babies. It is addicting until you run out of puzzle pieces.
Michael Peat,8/26/2022,"Good game to play when you're bored, but crashes too many times. Even when playing single player against the AI."
Kenny,8/3/2020,"The game is okay. Everytime I try to play with friends it kicks me out mid-game. Kinda annoying, rather just play the board game"
Scaramouche,7/15/2020,Amazing game but it's too short and predictable. Can't play this alone in a long run. Sometimes laggy but that's okay.
Jalisa Gunner,10/11/2023,The competitiveness doesn't get too bad and overall it's a wonderful game in the lads no nothing just peaceful gaming for my kid's.
Gunnardab,8/7/2020,I like this game somewhat however the fantasy was a let down. There were no fantasy pets still just dog and cat what about a dragon or elf or werewolf. Even the actions are the same . how about getting turned into something instead of taxes.
HI HI,7/5/2022,"Not what I expected, the game is too short and the game glitches often making me have to close the app and restart my game."
Adibah Rahani,11/27/2020,Better than the first the game of life version. Nice graphics and more variation. Nice to play with single or multiple people.
Juniper Whiskeytart,1/27/2022,Your game sucks it constantly tells and shows me I'm bad and it feels like the computer rigs the roulette you call it random I call it rigged it's a waste of time and money.
Anya Carpenter,2/3/2023,Ypu only ot one map and have to pay for rest whem I already had to buy the game. If you have to buy the games then you should get everything with it.
Paul Xiong,3/22/2023,Fun with the family! We play whenever we wait for our food at restaurants. Good way to keep the family engaged and entertained!
Dale Chambliss,3/14/2023,It's nothing like the actual board game and too me it kinda of sucks actually especially at over 500 mb for a game that isn't fun at all kinda of confusing I rather it be the board game like back in 1990's or 1980's board game was more fun than what u have here
Johann Murillo,6/6/2021,Its a fun game with different things to do but im giving this 4 stars since it can get very boring at times but it is a great game and suggest you should get it.
David Odorcic,10/3/2021,"Very good game! Great game to spend time with the family. The layout of the characters, maps/worlds is just very good. You will not be bored with this game. Good game!"
Rebecca Wilmot,5/13/2021,Only giving you 2 stars because I've played single player and online multi-player and have never won a single game...also the game cheats on mini games within the main game...I'm so disappointed that I actually paid for this app and can't win even one game!
Breanna Allen,1/6/2021,Different from the first game! Gameplay is still the same. Just more options and a fun spin on the original game of life!❤
Charlene Delgado,8/30/2023,It's awesome you can play with family members from different houses 😀
Sae Sae,2/1/2021,"The games not bad, but REALLY not worth the price. This game should be free with the amount of game play you get out of it. You could add so much to this game."
Alexus Matchett,2/24/2023,Love Love Love it!!! Awesome graphics and you don't have to pay for coins unless you want to. Also there are no ads!!!!
Vikalp Dubey,8/12/2023,"Too slow,Should have a fast-forward button"
Jasmine Johnson,11/28/2020,It's been a really fun game but I went in to debt one round and it tells you to pay before the end of the game but it never gives you the option to
Samwise Gamgee,7/30/2020,I really enjoy playing this game in Pass & Play mode with my family. But could you add ability to change human player names in Pass & Play mode?
EmpPhantom,4/19/2022,Absolutely love the game! Only thing I wish is that there were different difficulties for single-player to make it more interesting
Simone Green,1/6/2021,"I thought this would be better than the first one, but its not. The first one is way better. The graphics on this is better but the gameplay on the first is more true to the boardgame. Can I get my money back?"
Thomas Lockett,7/25/2020,"Too short, having a family in the game doesn't really give you any advantage and everyone you play with should be able to contribute to the achievements."
Vada Streeper,7/14/2022,One would expect that a game that you pay for would be fully unlocked and not have to pay to unlock different themed boards.
Bradley Hunt,12/18/2020,"I'd give it 5 stars but for 5 bucks on the frostland we should have at least reindeer as pets or polar bears. 🐻 💘 And on side note for the 5th star with the family pets, at least would make the pets white for dog's ""Huskys"" for example But other than that it's a cool game"
Maltrox,7/16/2020,The gameplay is good but buying for more maps it's disappointing; There should be a timer for every click.
Cai Png seller,11/25/2020,I should have known I would had only have one map and buy the others this is a joke! Why must I pay for the other maps as well and the other maps are all over price
Abbey Bint,3/12/2022,"A very nice game so far! I've played one game and it's really fun, I highly recommend definitely worth the money and I'm happy there are no ads atm :))"
Sinner Klotz,7/5/2022,Loved the game as a kid and this take on a classic board game is fun and entertaining and a nice way to pass the time great job to the developers keep up the good work 🙂
Glenn Coogan,4/18/2021,Not happy. Paid £3.99 for the game and £5.99 for the fantasy bundle to then play it and see that all of the actions in the fantasy world are the same as the normal game. Not impressed.
Stephen Mann,1/1/2021,Great game however when buying the extra maps it does not give you a new experience and no new challenges which means it might get a bit boring
Beau Culwell,10/2/2023,Great game great graphics works very well
Ashe Nguyen,7/19/2020,I love how you guys added more features to the game and it has less bugs too. Keep up the good work and everyone keep safe :)
Rachelle Harmon Harmon,2/22/2021,I enjoy it but the upgrades are so expensive it's discouraging. Sometimes I wish yall had loyalty points in games.
M Childers,8/23/2021,App isn't straight forward. Greedy to the max.... You get 1 world and pay $4.99 for different worlds without different features!! If you refuse their privacy policy then more features won't work.... The world is sick w greed
Christopher Bosse,11/2/2020,"Cool so I pay for an app... To get one map... I have to pay TWICE the price to open up another map... Or $30 for the 2 maps and 7 ""promised"" maps.... Sorry but no"
Benson Family Benson,1/2/2021,"Can't download, hangs up at 89 percent. Did everything that was suggested Cleared Cache and restarted. I have strong 5g. No support."
x-Mavrin_blitzgee-x,8/1/2023,"Although luck based, it's very balanced"
2023 Lean On Me!,6/1/2021,"Needs a way to, ""add friends,"" so users can better keep track of people they want to play with."
Big B,7/22/2020,"Great update to the classic game, since I had to pay for it I wish the new maps didn't cost extra."
Christopher Dalporto,12/4/2021,Excellent mobile game of life. Kind of greedy on the outfits though. Who is paying for outfits after already buying the base game? Make unlockable by playing! 👎
Graham Duncan,1/13/2023,"Good graphics, decent play but so limited, going off the game, keep getting put on with LEMON CAKE who takes 2mins per shot and adds up after 20shots to a big bore of an hour"
Cristin Powers,8/31/2022,This game is great. I love playing with my family. The only problem I have is the collections. I am not getting credit for growing my family. I have had babies and pets but they do not count.
Alana D. C- Walden,12/4/2020,Way btr then the first life!!! U guys did awesome on the graphics and the animation. I enjoyed playing this game very much. Thanks
Carrie Melendez,1/9/2023,I love the online and solo games. It is also worth spending a bit and getting all the boards and avatars unlocked.
Adam Afrilia,8/13/2023,"The game is so good in my opinion, I definitely will play this game with my fiancée, and it's so great🤗"
Mar With,4/23/2022,Really needs a timer for players turns More than half of every match I've played since I got this game is people playing for 2 seconds till they realize they lost and idle till you quit
Alyssa Cornish,3/2/2021,"I purchased this game thinking I would like it but it was kinda boring, Then when I tried to get a refund for the game but it uninstalled the game not giving me back my $3.99"
Carmen Riley,8/13/2020,"I love this game, but when i purchased the fairytale kingdom for 4.99, they charged me twice, and no kingdom, still got classic, I need my money back"
Mr Ghost,3/1/2021,Very fun and Spontaneity is also a nice change. Feels like your choices determine the outcome. Such is Life:)
Tammy Norton,11/20/2022,Not impressed with this game and couldn't get a refund. I wish you could try these games out first and see if you wanted to purchase it. I wish I could get a refund to purchase something else.
Quin EssentiaL,7/22/2020,A really cool game. Very creative. Had a fun time! Especially loved the animations.
Stacy Mulligan,9/29/2021,I love the pass and play option. We play 4 players at a time. Tons of fun. Can we play more than 4 players at a time?
Stephanie Mullins,3/6/2021,You think you're buying a game but if you want additional maps you have to pay even more. The game is buggy now and then. It's not worth the price.
Jennifer Grant,11/13/2022,I have tried and tried all troubleshooting steps but can not get this game to download for anything. Guess I'm stuck with the original
Jackson sepass,7/18/2021,Great game and all but I'm sick of waiting if I could give a plus I would after you make it two players one device and skip turn instead of waiting for single player
Corey Pelletier,12/3/2020,"So much wasted time, the sign drop off the next players name, waiting for other players turns, etc. Worst rendition of a classic game"
Sarah Lee,4/2/2021,"It's okay, its kind of slow. I wish it would just continue turns instead of all the stuff in between."
Stephanie Sommer,9/6/2021,"Purchased since it said eligible for family library, didn't appear in our library, reached out to developers for support and they just told me to contact google, no help, waste of $4 or I can pay another $8 to add to my kid's devices 🙄"
Scott,8/4/2020,"Great game, been playing it with my mum and fiance and we are having alot of fun, brings back childhood memories as I had the board game."
Daniel Gaudiello,6/4/2023,"I wish the original game was still on Google Play. This sequel is good, however it seems shorter than the original. Other than that good job"
Mark Hirsch (SSMD999),2/12/2021,The game should be little bit longer it is too short than the previous game also the game takes too long loading up and freezing a lot
Jessilyn Gray,1/4/2021,Game kept kicking me out I was only able to play one game all the way through then it kept kicking me out or freezing. I want my money back
Margaret Weigold,4/23/2023,I love the game. I just feel you should be able to unlock worlds not have to pay for them. Or make cheaper. You already have to pay for the game......
Kenny Abbs,9/3/2022,Cant even get through a full game without the app restarting my phone . This has been an ongoing problem. Please get this fixed
Lucas Parsons,5/15/2021,"This is a great game. I love the new options. My only problem with the game so far, and the only reason I'm rating it 4 stars instead of five, is the fact that I just had the game crash on me."
Robert Cedeno,2/21/2022,"Great game gets long add chat for wait , and also allow us to add friends with players we played with , since most people we know don't play."
Cat Ammann,5/16/2021,"Not worth the money I play better game without having to pay any money. It's got nice graphics but nope, not worth the money."
Crystal Klink,8/31/2020,So far so good everything works great the spinner works way better and the graphics are really cool.
Tracey Lee,2/3/2022,Love playing this game. The only thing I would like to mention is u cannot find the rules of game play anywhere. Can the rules me provided or included please
Rebecca Petrie,7/12/2021,"Really slow, kept stopping, didn't find out who won at the end of the game. Refunded."
Nicole Thompson,1/3/2021,"Just downloaded the game and I can only use the app until the game goes to load (single, multiplayer, press and play have all been tried) and then the app shuts off"
Brieanna Kirton,12/3/2020,Game works fine haven't had any issues with it. I like the game I just wish there were more ingame tasks to do and the road was longer
Stef Ingham,12/15/2020,I love this game. I only have one suggestion. Make the action cards unique to each board. That would just put it all together so nicely.
Jordan Dunn,8/1/2022,Really fun game. Great for passing time.Just don't like the fact that it doesn't bring progress to new device.
Michael Jenkins,1/17/2021,The only complaint I have is the boards needs to be longer. Also how many more boards come out with the season pass?
Daisy Flower,1/23/2023,Really good game. Love to play it with my friends and there is ai players if you want to play alone. Definitely worth it!
LilaJean Seder,11/12/2021,"Cute, fun game but the online and play with friends options don't work. Those were my main reason behind buying this game so 3 stars."
Clifford Beilke,3/4/2021,less options and gameplay than the board game. Gets boring after 3 or 4 games. Not worth paying for.
Mr V,1/7/2022,Its fun and all until u play it like months or weeks u will get bored. The game is too repetitive need more complexity.
Jen Chong Wong,5/15/2022,The game wants you to buy in store items with money again to unlock new stuff. Game play is also too short.
AM R,7/11/2021,Error in multiplayer offline..when I get turn..it's loading too long and have back to main menu...but game is fun
Nic K,4/25/2023,Very fun!! No ads is awesome and tons of fun to play with the wife! Will definitely recommend to everyone!
Kristi-ann Johnson,8/6/2020,I paid $57 for the season pass and got nothing! 😡 I'll be launching a dispute with PayPal and getting refunded !!
Autumn Matthews,12/25/2022,"Definitely a fun, competitive game experience. Was able to even get my 13 year old involved and had fun."
Keith King,11/17/2020,(EDIT on my last post today) The additional map that I purchased unlocks when the game is online. So it's not a total offline game.
Sassy Chimpanzee,11/7/2020,"It's for some reason extremely boring to play it this way. I have a lot of fun playing with the actual boardgame, but this version is just so boring."
Christopher Radenovic,9/3/2020,Totally worth 3 bucks lol. You can buy 9 coming soon versions of the game of life for the price of one board game.
Jasmine Rose,9/24/2020,"I love this game, lots of fun. I have given it 4 star's as sometimes the game freezes otherwise it would of been 5 star's."
GiGi,2/14/2021,It's just like the board game I have in my closet! I love the option that you don't have to play with friends online you can also do single player.
Robert Voigt,7/22/2020,"Having enjoyed the first game, having the board game being one of my favourites growing up, I think your team have done an excellent job on the 2nd edition Thumbs up and Up 👍👍"
Mesmerizing Reflections,10/5/2020,"Fun, but I wish we could choose if we want to adopt a dog or a cat instead of it being assigned to us. I'd like to see more themes too."
spleef playz,11/19/2020,Amazing game and great things to buy i like that it has different maps and characters and vesicles to best game ever 1000000% download it if you can pay like me just be carefull
Douglas Byrne,11/12/2020,Have taken the fun out of playing the game of life automatically gives just two choices rather then mini games as in part one original Hasbro game of life.
rotokomoto,7/16/2020,Tbh I hated the first one it was low quality and not worth money but this one is one of the best mobile games in a while it takes a spin on the orginal idea and makes it better!
William Martinez Jr.,7/23/2023,Always loved the board game this is just as fun
Fox8MyDinner,8/20/2023,Ever bit as good as on console and pc
Jeff Jacob,10/9/2021,"I've never seen a game hacked so hard. Whatever the worst outcome is for you, best believe THAT number will come up. Worst $2 I ever spent in my life!"
Omar Samer,4/4/2022,"Eveytime I reach the end the game gets lag, why? That will let me to get rid of the game if it doesn't get fixed."
Angie Merckel,7/24/2020,It's pretty good. I just wish there would be a way to pay back your loans before the game is over but I have tried everything and I can't figure it out. But the game is over all pretty fun.
Danny Gutierrez,8/20/2020,I can only get up to the college sapce in the game and then after that it shuts down I can't enjoy the game with this problem.
maria sharpe,11/13/2021,"I always loved the board game Life and this is just as great. Great graphics, easy to understand and play!"
Janmark Saculinggan,12/2/2020,They say they will fix the freeze bug in the comments but it is not. it keeps freezing.
Andrew Souder,1/2/2023,"Fun game, just like the Board game, little annoying that after paying for the game you have to pay to unlock different boards"
Lexus Keyes,9/2/2020,"I bought 2, 3.99 bundles and never received them, idk why or how, but im very uoset that i wasted money on nothing. I was really enjoying this game.."
Jenny R,1/4/2022,Not very impressed as I've bought a few things and they've not loaded on to the game. And it's qnnoying and I'm disabled it helps my mental health .please help .
Eva Lewis,7/18/2020,Super fun on your own. I like to play this game with my kids. Haven't tried online yet. Would be better if you could have a profile share across multiple devices
HazzyMD,8/13/2020,"You get a smooth game every so often, but the rest of the time it bugs out or crashes"
Stephanie Trudeau,5/25/2022,Already paid for the game but to unlock it all you need to pay $34.99... it also freezes up mid and end game at times
Samantha Sappington,8/8/2020,"Loved this game ever since I was 4 years old and has the original Playstation disk copy and board game, glad to still be able to play!"
Gemma Dawson,7/19/2022,I love it it is werlt the money becauae it can be played offline and no word to say how fun it is i recim. you can play with family and friends but to play with friends and family it takes wifi
Lisa Torres,10/7/2023,I had fun playing it.
Kirito,7/16/2021,"I like the game and everything about it, but the only glich is that when you sell your house and pick an envelope you cant say no I don't want to sell my house for that price, even tho it says you can"
Derek Gregg,7/24/2022,"Really fun, and enjoyable game with no wrong paths, or ways to succeed in it. Loving The Game Of Life 2!"
Katie Davidson,10/9/2021,It is really fun to play with family but the only thing is that you have to wate a long time ⌛to switch players but other than that it is amazing 👏
Dareece Luze,1/2/2022,We have an adaptive switch for my daughter with Cerebral Palsy. This game is perfect for us. So fun!
Marra Ludahl,10/15/2020,I like the game my only complaint is you have to pay to play the other world that should have come with the game when you first buy it other than that good for killing time
Hayden Owen,3/19/2021,Defintly cute but feels limited on your options to choose from or action/bucket list items. Still fun :)
Mr. Mom,6/7/2022,"Nothing but lower rolls and nothing above a 4, online doesn't work, I paid $4 for a game that is broken. Would give zero star's if I could."
Faceless Goddess,7/8/2021,"Really fun and has very little bugs, I do wish that they gave you more puzzles since they go by so quickly."
Jeu Escobido,7/29/2020,"It freezes mid game. Can click menu, end game etc but game wont continue. Needs update."
Althea Claridge,3/9/2023,"I love this version, would be nice if you could win puzzle pieces when playing online in worlds you don't own."
AYEYUUDHE,11/16/2022,Never saves my progress. Always have to start completely over at enter my age when I play. Ridiculous.
Kayla Forseth,9/21/2020,This game is so fun to play im going play again and again. What a blast game good job. The board is different thats why its so cool.
Nemesis Saladbar,9/20/2021,I can't select to be ready idk what to do other than that the game is fun for the most part it must be some sort of bug.
Sherita Griffin,8/4/2020,I really enjoy how the game has changed. I really like the gameplay different with more things to do. Great job
Mr. Lost,6/2/2021,Spent 5 dollars on a map and it wont let me choose to play on the map when joining someone else and also doesnt give me anything towards the outfits or anything else from those matches
Robert Laws,10/27/2020,Fun to play. Easy to play. One thing I would change is let everyone spin to see who goes first.
David Jia Xing,4/28/2021,Ok. The game breaking bugs make it unenjoyable. Every other game will make freeze at the end :sadface:

Meghan Dore,7/21/2020,Game won't load. Yellow green screen. Made sure it's updated to current version. Very disappointed.
Britney Thompson,3/6/2021,I've been playing this game for a while then within the last day or so when I open the game you can't push the start button and it doesn't make any sound. What happened to your game?
Tiffany Partanen,8/27/2020,The game isn't quite what I expected and I'm not enjoying it sadly after a few plays. Is there anyway possible for my $3.99 refund or even credit for another game? I'd appreciate thanks
fei,8/22/2020,"It's very fun but kinda short, wish there was more options. But it's really fun to play 4/5 stars 😊"

Garrett Blake,12/8/2020,Have to update the game and put more variety and change of scenery and customization please. Thanks :)
Diane Delaney,5/11/2022,This game is fun. But it seems like a awfully short game. I like games were it takes more than 10 minutes to play.
Trevor Pellegrini,9/7/2021,Not a bad game but wouldn't hurt to do some occasional updates. Bought this back in 2019 and no updates since.
aemomma1,7/16/2020,Good game if you can get a game to load up without crashing. I get the game stopped responding often.

Austin Rogers,8/16/2023,I love this game and the cute worlds.
Stephanie Rowland,10/20/2020,"So much fun, love the choices you get to have, and love the idea you can adopt a pet too!! 😀"
Shimel Morris,5/14/2022,"Love this game. Easy game play great connection, just needs a better way of getting the other boards."
Tonya Nichols,4/19/2022,It would have been cool if we get a holiday worlds. I love the game and graphics. I love how you have goals to reach.
Noah Young,7/17/2020,Fun game. Little different then the traditional board game but alot easier to keep up with.
Josh Jenkins,7/22/2020,Very short and not very fun. Should have made it more like the original board game or Twist and Turns.
BIGMIKE,11/27/2020,The game of LIFE is a game i grew up playing when I was a kid. To see this on mobile and play it again was a lot of fun.
Alex Mitchell,10/27/2021,"Was a great game at first but for the past 2 weeks I have not be able to play online, which is what I mainly use it for, idk what's going on, but I bought the vip pack and 2 days later I can't play with my family"

Christine Furler,9/30/2020,Downloaded game for it to constantly freeze after each turn. Fun but too glitchy.
Rob Lecuyer,8/8/2020,Game is glitchy. When I should receive a book or heart it doesnt always give it. Will rate 5 star once fixed
DreamyCaku,7/15/2020,The quality of the game was smooth and there were a lot more options in the game. I really enjoyed playing the game totally worth the money spent on this.
GhostPhantasm,7/18/2020,"More improved, but the in app purchases ruin it. The get any of the cool additions you have to pay more."
Natalie Gambrill,8/7/2020,"Is fun, but board game needs to be longer and you have to be forced to purchase a house."
Sapphire Kennon,4/12/2022,Kinda upset tried to buy season bundle wont let me then made me update my game and upon re entering I had lost everything and it started me over.
Anthony Sullivan,4/13/2021,This game I thought would be fun but again with this woke generation they let you pick male female or Trans or whatever and you can marry between them and have kids yeah right male and female is normal anything else is mental illness. Even though I paid for it I will uninstall this garbage. Also even if it didn't have the mental ill trash making you buy the extras which is more than the game itself is pathetic no matter what the developers explain as the reason for it. It is still pathetic.
René Shaw,2/19/2021,"Always been a fan of the game, good version with nice inclusion for non traditional families and lifestyles."
Eric Nelsen,7/15/2020,"The Game of Life will always have a special place in my heart, but now part 2 takes Life to a whole new level of playing! I love this game!"

Robert Hu,7/3/2023,Single player was fun.
Kirstin,7/15/2022,I love to play the board game but when Im by myself I can't play. This is a really good way to play the game when you're by yourself; I will play it often👍🏻
Spencer Hanks,11/15/2021,"This is a great game you can play with random people, with friends, and even with npc's!"
Suburban Hell,2/16/2022,Selling houses you're supposed to get 3 attempts but it automatically takes the first attempt every time.
Allison vugteveen,8/28/2020,I like the game but when u play vs the computer it doesnt put the star in the correct lucky number on the wheel or give its player the correct job
Shawn M,8/8/2022,Keeps telling us to update the game for multi-player. But there's no option to update on iPhone.
Retro Cowboy,9/23/2021,Really great game and fun. I rage quit a lot cause im a sour loser but it happens to the best of us. Great game over all.

Sahil Saluja,11/25/2020,"Not even able to install... Download gets stuck at 98%, not facing download issue on any other app/game. I think I wasted my money."
Reiji Tayag,12/6/2020,"I watch my character for 10 minutes and guess what, it's level 45 already, this is for kids game, I'm looking for a grand chase pc type game on mobile but its hopeless, almost all are stupid auto play"
Sam yeknom,9/24/2022,"Love it! Totally worth having on my phone, I do pass & play a lot, but the online play is good too!"

Joseph Johnson,5/4/2022,I keep trying to play online and it say no internet connection I've re-download it restarted my phone everything. It's not working

Marck Cortez,1/5/2023,"It's good but I prefer the first The game of life. By the way, what happened? You took it away from the store. I bought some skins there now I can't play it anymore. Why did you take the game of life from the store?"
Familia Herrera Perez,7/12/2021,"This game is amazing almost as amazing the first game of life, this game was worth $2.74 and I hope they make newer, better and crazier games this game is magnificent and maybe fix a problem with the first game of life"
